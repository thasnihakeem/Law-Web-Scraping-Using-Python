PC against her children. Even under the Act the application of the provisions of Section 125 of Cr. PC has been contemplated and the Act has n ot\xa0 specifically made any ouster of the application of Section 125 Cr.PC Section 5 of the Act has imposed one condition for the application of sections 125 to 128 of Cr. P C against former husband of the divorced Muslim woman but it is conspicuously silent as regards their application against others. The framework of the Act itself and the ratio decided in the case of Danial Latifi (supra) which we have discussed above will show that the Act itself is not a substituted measure of Section 125 of Cr. P C but in addition thereto.\xa0This suggests that the proceeding under Section 125 of Cr.PC against children of the respondent mother is quite maintainable despite the pendency of the proceeding under sections 3, 4 of the Act against her husband. \xa0 IN THE HIGH COURT OF CALCUTTA C.R.R. No. 516 of 2001 Decided On: 10.12.2001 Makiur Rahaman Kha and Ors.\xa0Vs.\xa0\xa0Mahila Bibi Hon\'ble Judges/Coram: N.C. Sil, J. Citation:\xa0MANU/WB/0390/2001. 1. The present revisional application was directed against the order dated 24.01.2001 passed by Sri M. S. Dwivedy, learned Sub-divisional Judicial Magistrate, Uluberia, Howrah in connection with Misc. Case No. 85 of 1998 under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 2. In the said application the maintenance under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was claimed by the mother, who was divorced by her husband, from her two sons. The learned Sub-divisional Judicial Magistrate after having considered the materials placed before him was pleased to allow the application for maintenance under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and directed the O. P. sons to pay a sum of Rs. 250/- each per month from the date of filing of the petition. 3. It is stated in the revisional application that the respondent mother had filed application under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure being Misc. Case No. 155 of 1986 claiming maintenance from her husband and her husband took the plea in that case that he had since divorced his wife and she was thus determined to be a divorced Muslim woman. It is also stated in the revisional application as to how the petitioner No. 2 was neglected by his mother who had left the house of her husband at the time when the petitioner No. 2 was a mere child of 3/4 years. It is also stated that the petitioner No. 2 is an assistant of his brother, the petitioner No. 1 and the petitioner No. 1 earns only Rs. 100/- per month while the earning of petitioner No. 2 is only R. 50/- per month. It is also stated that the respondent-mother failed to discharge her duties by showing love and affection to the revisionists and she had left the house of her husband of her own without any reason. It is again stated in the revisional application that a divorced Muslim wife is not entitled to claim maintenance from her sons as there is no provision under the Muslim law. It is also mentioned that the respondent mother has filed a Misc. Case No. 15 of 1997 under Sections 3, 4 of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 against her husband which is still pending. 4. It is argued by the learned Advocate for the revisionists before me that since a maintenance case filed by the respondent mother against her husband under Sections 3, 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as \'Act\' for brevity), the parallel proceeding under Section 125 of Cr. P C against her sons is not maintainable. The learned Advocate for the respondents has drawn my attention to the provisions of the Section 3(3) of the Act and tries to impress upon me that the husband of a divorced Muslim woman is obliged to pay maintenance to his divorced wife during her life time till her re-marriage.  The learned Advocate for the respondent has, on the other hand, drawn my attention to the provisions of Section 125(1)(d) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and tries, to Impress upon me that the divorced woman is also entitled to get maintenance from her sons and the proceeding under Section 3 of the Act is only against the husband of the divorced Muslim woman. 5. It appears from the judgment of the learned trial Magistrate that a similar point was raised before him but the learned Magistrate just relying on the submissions of learned advocate for the petitioner before him came to the conclusion that the sons of the petitioner are liable to pay maintenance to their mother under Section 125 Cr. P C. 6. Thus, the point for consideration before us is whether a divorced Muslim woman is entitled to invoke the provisions of Section 125 of Cr.PC for her maintenance against her sons and whether such a proceeding under Section 125 of Cr. P C against the sons of the divorced Muslim woman is maintainable when a proceeding under sections 3, 4 of the Act is pending before the Court of competent Jurisdiction. 7. Section 3 Sub-section (3) Clause (a) of the Act reads as under : ""Where an application has been made under Sub-section (2) by a divorced woman, the Magistrate may, if he is satisfied that- (a) her husband having sufficient means, has failed or neglected to make of pay her with in the iddat period a reasonable and fair provision and maintenance for her and the children"" The word ""within"" has stolen many judicial hours of the Judges and generated much controversies over its use and implication particularly in view of the interests of the relatives in the properties to be inherited after the demise of the divorced Muslim woman and to pay maintenance to her and also the liabilities of the State Wakf Board to pay such maintenance to such divorced Muslim woman under the provisions of Section 4 Sub-sections (1) and (2) of the Act. In almost all the judicial pronouncements the backdrop of Shah Bano\'s case (Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum, MANU/SC/0194/1985 : 1985CriLJ875 ) sometimes the word ""within"" had been interpreted as ""for"" and sometime as ""during"". But on close scrutiny and having taken the entire gamut of the Act into consideration, it appears that the word ""within"" finds mention in number of places in the Act. Accordingly there arises no occasion to conceive of the situation that the legislators were forgetful about implication and purport of the word ""within"" giving rise to any speculation to go for other interpretation of the word than its usual and ordinary meaning. The question may be posed against this line of thought as to why the provisions of maintenance from the relatives and then from the State Wakf Board have been incorporated in the Act. In order to find the answer and keep the word ""within"" appearing in Clause (a) of sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the Act within its natural and literal meaning, the capability of the Muslim husband who has divorced his wife to pay and provide reasonable and fair maintenance may be conceived in its proper perspective. And this leads me to believe that where the Muslim husband is incapable of maintaining his divorced wife who is incapable of maintaining herself and not remarried, the provisions for maintenance from other sources contemplated and provided in the provisos to Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Act and this is how the word ""within"" appearing in Clause (a) Sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the Act may be kept within its natural and literate meaning. 8. Our above view finds support from the ration decided in the case of Danial Latifi & Anr. v. Union of India MANU/SC/0595/2001 : 2001CriLJ4660 in which it was observed by the Special Bench of the Hon\'ble Supreme Court consisting of five Hon\'ble Judges: \'The contention that the expression ""within"" in Section 3(1)(a) should be read as ""during"" or ""for"" cannot be accepted because words cannot be construed contrary to their meaning as the word ""within"" would mean ""on or before"", ""not beyond"" and, therefore, it was held that the Act would mean that on or before the expiration of the iddat period, the husband is bound to make and pay maintenance to the wife and if he fails to do so then the wife is entitled to recover it by filing an application before the Magistrate as provided in Section 3(3) but nowhere has Parliament provided that reasonable and fair provision and maintenance is limited only for the iddat period and not beyond it. It would extend to the whole life of the divorced wife unless she gets married for a second time."" 9. The Constitutional validity of the Muslim Woman (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 has been challenged before the Hon\'ble Supreme Court in the case of Danial Latifi (supra) and it was submitted that, ""(i) Section 125 Cr.PC, was enacted as a matter of public policy, in order to provide a quick summary remedy to persons unable to maintain themselves; that the provision reflected the moral stance of the law and ought not to have been entangled with religion and religion-based personal laws; (ii) Section 125 Cr. P C also furthers the concept of social justice embodied in Article 21 of the Constitution of India; hence excluding divorced Muslim women from its protection is a discrimination against them; (iii) the inevitable effect of the Act is to nullify the law declared by the Supreme Court in Shah Bano case MANU/SC/0194/1985 : 1985CriLJ875 , which is most improper; (iv) the Act is un-Islamic and also has the potential to suffocate Muslim women and to undermine the basic secular character of the Constitution; (v) the Act is violative of Articles 14 and 21."" 10. After hearing the parties the Special Bench consisting of five Hon\'ble Judges of the Hon\'ble Supreme Court was pleased to uphold the validity of the Act and sum up their conclusions as below : "" 1. A Muslim husband is liable to make reasonable and fair provision for the future of the divorced wife which obviously includes her maintenance as well. Such a reasonable and fair provision extending beyond the iddat period must be made by the husband within the iddat period in terms of Section 3(1)(a) of the Act. 2. Liability of a Muslim husband to his divorced wife arising under Section 3(1)(a) of the Act to pay maintenance is not confirmed to the iddat period. 3. A divorced Muslim woman who has not remarried and who is not able to maintain herself after the iddat period can proceed as provided under Section 4 of the Act against her relatives who are liable to maintain her in proportion to the properties which they inherit on her death according to Muslim law from such divorced woman including her children and parents. If any of the relatives being unable to pay maintenance, the Magistrate may direct the State Wakf Board established under the Act to pay such maintenance. 4. The provisions of the Act do not offend Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India."" The Hon\'ble Supreme Court was further pleased to hold that. ""All other matters where there are other questions raised, the same shall stand relegated for consideration by appropriate Benches of this Court."" 11. It is clear that a Muslim divorced woman cannot invoke the provisions of Section 125 of Cr. P C against her former husband if she does not exercise her option under the provisions of Section 5 of the Act.  Section 4(1) of the Act contains the provision for maintenance to the divorced woman from her children but this does in fact not debar the divorced Muslim woman from invoking the provision of Section 125 of Cr. PC against her children. Even under the Act the application of the provisions of Section 125 of Cr. PC has been contemplated and the Act has n ot  specifically made any ouster of the application of Section 125 Cr.PC Section 5 of the Act has imposed one condition for the application of sections 125 to 128 of Cr. P C against former husband of the divorced Muslim woman but it is conspicuously silent as regards their application against others. The framework of the Act itself and the ratio decided in the case of Danial Latifi (supra) which we have discussed above will show that the Act itself is not a substituted measure of Section 125 of Cr. P C but in addition thereto. This suggests that the proceeding under Section 125 of Cr.PC against children of the respondent mother is quite maintainable despite the pendency of the proceeding under sections 3, 4 of the Act against her husband.  I do not find any illegality or irregularity as regards the amount of maintenance awarded by the learned Magistrate in favour of the respondent mother against her children under Section 125 of Cr. P C. Accordingly, the present revisional application is dismissed on contest. The impugned order dated 24.1.2001 passed by the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Uluberia is hereby affirmed. The parties are directed to bear their respective costs.'}"

Maintenance for the prescribed period referred to in Clause (b) of Section 3(1) is granted on the claim of the divorced mother on her own behalf for maintaining the infant/infants for a period of two years from the date of the birth of the child concerned who is/are living with her and presumably is aimed at providing some extra amount to the mother for her nourishment for nursing or taking care of the infant/infants upto a period of\xa0two years.\xa0It has nothing to do with the right of the child/children to claim maintenance under Section 125, Cr. P.C. So long as the conditions for the grant of maintenance under Section 125, Cr. P.C. are satisfied, the rights of the minor children, unable to maintain themselves, are not affected by Section 3(I Mb) of the 1986 Act. Under Section 125, Cr. P.C. the maintenance of the children is obligatory on the father (irrespective of his religion) and as long as he is in a position to do so and the children have no independent means of their own. it remains his absolute obligation to provide for them.  Insofar as children born of Muslim parents are concerned there is nothing in Section 125. Cr. P.C. which exempts a Muslim father from his obligation to maintain the children. These provisions are not affected by Clause (b) of Section 3(1) of the 1986 Act and indeed it would be unreasonable, unfair, inequitable and even preposterous to deny the benefit of Section 125, Cr. P.C. to the children only on the ground that they are born of Muslim parents. The effect of a beneficial legislation like Section 125, Cr. P.C., cannot be allowed to be defeated except through clear provisions of a statute.  We do not find manifestation of any such intention in the 1986 Act to take away the independent rights of the children to claim maintenance under Section 125, Cr. P.C. where they are minor and are unable to maintain themselves. Muslim father\'s obligation, like that of a Hindu father, to maintain his minor children as contained in Section 125, Cr.P.C. is absolute and is not at all affected by Section 3(1)(b) of the 1986 Act. Indeed a Muslim father can claim custody of the children born through the divorced wife to fulfil his obligation to maintain them and if he succeeds, he need not suffer an order or direction under Section 125, Cr.P.C. but where such custody has not been claimed by him, he cannot refuse and neglect to maintain his minor children on the ground that he has divorced their mother. The right of the children to claim maintenance under Section 125, Cr.P.C. is separate, distinct and independent of the right of their divorcee\xa0mother to claim maintenance for herself for maintaining the infant children upto the age of 2 years from the date of birth of the concerned child under Section 3(1) of the Act. There is nothing in the 1986 Act which in any manner affects the application of the provisions of Sections 125-128 of the Cr.P.C, relating to grant of maintenance insofar as minor children of Muslim parents, unable to maintain I themselves, are concerned. \xa0 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Criminal Appeal No. 1197 of 1995 Decided On: 29.07.1997 Noor Saba Khatoon\xa0\xa0Vs.\xa0\xa0Mohd. Quasim Hon\'ble Judges/Coram: Dr. A.S. Anand and K. Venkataswami, JJ. Author: Dr. A.S. Anand, J. Citation:\xa0\xa0MANU/SC/0827/1997. 1. A short but interesting question involved in this appeal, by Special Leave, is whether the children of Muslim parents are entitled to grant of maintenance under Section 125, Cr.P.C. for the period till they attain majority or are able to maintain themselves, whichever date is earlier, or in the case of female children till they get married or is their right restricted to the grant of maintenance only for a period of two years prescribed under Section 3(1)(b) of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 notwithstanding Section 125, Cr. P.C. 2. The appellant married the respondent according to Muslim rites on 27-10-1980. During the wedlock, three children were born - two daughters and a son. On certain disputes arising between the parties, the respondent allegedly turned the appellant out of the matrimonial home along with the three children then aged 6 years, 3 years and l 1/2 years and also refused and neglected to maintain her and the children thereafter. After turning the appellant out of the matrimonial home, the respondent took a second wife, Shahnawax Begum. Claiming that the appellant has no means to maintain herself and the children and that the respondent had both agricultural land and was carrying on business in electrical appliances as well and had sufficient income and means to maintain them, she filed an application under Section 125, Cr. P.C, in the Court of Shri A.K. Jha, Judicial Magistrate. First Class, Gopalganj. on 13-2-1992. She claimed a sum of Rs. 400/- per month for herself and Rs. 300/- per month as maintenance for each of the three children. The application was contested, though it was only the appellant, who adduced evidence at the trial and the respondent/husband did not lead any evidence. The Trial Court found that the respondent had failed and neglected to maintain his wife and children and that they had no source of income or means to maintain themselves and accordingly held that they were entitled to the grant of maintenance from the respondent. By its order dated 19-1-1993. the Trial Court directed the respondent to pay maintenance to the appellant at the rate of Rs. 200/- per month for herself and at the rate of Rs. 150/- per month for each of the three minor children, till they attain the age of majority. While the mailer rested thus, the respondent divorced the appellant and thereafter filed an application in the Trial Court seeking modification of the order dated 19-1-1993, in view of the provisions of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act. 1986 (hereinafter referred to as the 1986 Act). By an order dated 27-7-1993, the Trial Court modified the order dated 19-1-1993. insofar as the grant of maintenance to the appellant is concerned while maintaining the order granting maintenance to each of the three minor children. Insofar as the appellant is concerned, the Trial Court held that in view of the provisions of the 1986 Act the appellant-wife after her divorce was entitled to maintenance only for a period of three months i.e. for the period of Iddat. The Trial Court further found that the right to maintenance under Section 125. Cr. P.C. insofar as the children are concerned was not affected by the 1986 Act in any manner. The order dated 27-7-1993 was challenged by the respondent through a Revision Petition in the Court of 2nd Additional Judge, Gopalganj. On 16-7-1994, the revisional Court dismissed the revision petition holding that the 1986 Act does not override the provisions of Section 125, Cr. P.C. for grant of maintenance to the minor children and that Section 3(1)(b) of the 1986 Act also entitles a divorced woman to claim reasonable and fair maintenance from her husband for maintaining the children born to her before or after her divorce from her former husband for a period of two years from the respective dates of birth of the children and that the said provision did not affect the right to maintenance of the minor children granted by Section 125, Cr. P.C. The respondent, thereupon, filed a Criminal Misc. Petition under Section 482, Cr. P.C. in the High Court challenging the correctness of that part of the order of the revisional Court which upheld the right to maintenance of the three minor children under Section 125, Cr. P.C. at the rate of Rs. 150A per month per child. A learned single Judge of the High Court accepted the plea of the respondent that vide Section 3(1)(b) of the 1986 Act, a divorced Muslim woman is entitled to claim maintenance from her previous husband for her minor children only for a period of two years from the date of birth of the concerned child and that the minor children were not entitled to claim maintenance under Section 125, Cr. P.C. after the coming into force of the 1986 Act. The High Court noticed that the two older children were aged 6 years and 3 years when the application for maintenance was filed on their behalf by their mother, and thus had completed two years prior to filing of the petition for grant of maintenance"", and as such those two children were held not entitled to the grant of any maintenance under Section 125, Cr. P.C. and that the third child, who was only 1 1/2 years of age on 19-1-1993, was entitled to receive maintenance till she attained the age of two years i.e. till 19-7-1993 from the date of filing of the application i.e. 13-2-1992. With the said modification, the miscellaneous application of the respondent-husband was partly allowed. By special leave to appeal the appellant has come up to this Court. 3. The facts are not in dispute. The appellant had filed a petition for grant of maintenance under Section 125, Cr. P.C. for herself as well as on behalf of the three children born during the wedlock, who were living with her, since the respondent had refused and neglected to maintain them. On the date of the application filed under Section 125, Cr. P.C. i.e. 13-2- 1992, the children were aged 6 years, 3 years and 1 1/2 years. After the Trial Court granted the petition under Section 125, Cr. P.C. in favour of the appellant and the three minor children, me respondent divorced the appellant and filed an application seeking modification of the order of maintenance in view of the provisions of the 1986 Act. The trial Court modified its order qua the appellant, restricting the grant of maintenance to the period of Iddat but maintained its earlier order insofar as the children are concerned. While the revisional Court declined to interfere with the order of the Trial Court, the High Court based itself on Section 3(1)(b) of the 1986 Act to hold that the grant of maintenance to the children of divorced Muslim parents, living with their mother, was restricted to the period prescribed under the said section notwithstanding the provisions of Section 125, Cr. P.C. 4. Does Section 3(1)(b) of the 1986 Act in any way affect the rights of the minor children of divorced Muslim parents to the grant of maintenance under Section 125, Cr. P.C. is thus the moot question? 5. The preamble to the 1986 Act reads: An Act to protect the rights of Muslim women who have been divorced by, or have obtained divorce from their husbands and to provide for matters connected there with or incidental thereto. 6. The Act. thus, aims to protect the rights of Muslim Women who have been divorced.  The 1986 Act was enacted as a sequel to the judgment in Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum MANU/SC/0194/1985 : 1985CriLJ875 . The question of maintenance of children was not involved in the controversy arising out of the judgment in the case of Shah Bano Begum (supra).  The Act was not enacted to regulate the obligations of a Muslim father to maintain his minor children unable to maintain themselves which continued to be governed with Section 125, Cr. P.C. This position clearly emerges from a perusal of the relevant provisions of the 1986 Act. 7. Section 3 of the 1986 Act to the extent relevant for this case reads: Section 3. Mahr or other properties of Muslim women to be given to her at the time of divorce.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, a divorced woman shall be entitled to- (a) a reasonable and fair provision and maintenance to be made and paid to her within the Iddat period by her former husband; (b) where she herself maintains the children born to her before or after her divorce, a reasonable and fair provision and maintenance to be made and paid by her former husband for a period of two years from the respective dates of birth of such children; (c) an amount equal to the sum of mahr or dower agreed to be paid to her at the lime of her marriage or at any time thereafter according to Muslim law; and (d) all the properties given to her before or at the time of marriage or after the marriage by her relatives or friends or the husband or any relatives of the husband or his friends. From a plain reading of the above Section it is manifest that it deals with ""Mahr"" or other properties of a Muslim woman to be given to her at the time of divorce. It lays down that a reasonable and fair provision has to be made for payment of maintenance to her during the period of Iddat by her former husband.  Clause (b) of Section 3(1) (supra) provides for grant of additional maintenance to her for the fosterage period of two years from the date of birth of the child of marriage for maintaining that child during the fosterage. Maintenance for the prescribed period referred to in Clause (b) of Section 3(1) is granted on the claim of the divorced mother on her own behalf for maintaining the infant/infants for a period of two years from the date of the birth of the child concerned who is/are living with her and presumably is aimed at providing some extra amount to the mother for her nourishment for nursing or taking care of the infant/infants upto a period of two years. It has nothing to do with the right of the child/children to claim maintenance under Section 125, Cr. P.C. So long as the conditions for the grant of maintenance under Section 125, Cr. P.C. are satisfied, the rights of the minor children, unable to maintain themselves, are not affected by Section 3(I Mb) of the 1986 Act. Under Section 125, Cr. P.C. the maintenance of the children is obligatory on the father (irrespective of his religion) and as long as he is in a position to do so and the children have no independent means of their own. it remains his absolute obligation to provide for them. Insofar as children born of Muslim parents are concerned there is nothing in Section 125. Cr. P.C. which exempts a Muslim father from his obligation to maintain the children. These provisions are not affected by Clause (b) of Section 3(1) of the 1986 Act and indeed it would be unreasonable, unfair, inequitable and even preposterous to deny the benefit of Section 125, Cr. P.C. to the children only on the ground that they are born of Muslim parents. The effect of a beneficial legislation like Section 125, Cr. P.C., cannot be allowed to be defeated except through clear provisions of a statute. We do not find manifestation of any such intention in the 1986 Act to take away the independent rights of the children to claim maintenance under Section 125, Cr. P.C. where they are minor and are unable to maintain themselves. Muslim father\'s obligation, like that of a Hindu father, to maintain his minor children as contained in Section 125, Cr.P.C. is absolute and is not at all affected by Section 3(1)(b) of the 1986 Act. Indeed a Muslim father can claim custody of the children born through the divorced wife to fulfil his obligation to maintain them and if he succeeds, he need not suffer an order or direction under Section 125, Cr.P.C. but where such custody has not been claimed by him, he cannot refuse and neglect to maintain his minor children on the ground that he has divorced their mother. The right of the children to claim maintenance under Section 125, Cr.P.C. is separate, distinct and independent of the right of their divorcee mother to claim maintenance for herself for maintaining the infant children upto the age of 2 years from the date of birth of the concerned child under Section 3(1) of the Act. There is nothing in the 1986 Act which in any manner affects the application of the provisions of Sections 125-128 of the Cr.P.C, relating to grant of maintenance insofar as minor children of Muslim parents, unable to maintain I themselves, are concerned. 8. Indeed Section 3(1) of 1986 Act begins with a non obstante clause ""notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force"" and Clause (b) thereof provides that a divorced woman shall be entitled to a reasonable and fair provision for maintenance by her former husband to maintain the children born out of the wedlock for a period of two years from the date of birth of such children, but the non obsolete clause in our opinion only restricts and confines the right of a divorcee Muslim woman to claim or receive maintenance for herself and for maintenance of the child/children till they attain the age of two years, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force in that behalf. It has nothing to do with the independent right or entitlement of the minor children to be maintained by their Muslim father. A careful reading of the provisions of Section 125, Cr. PC. and Section 3(1)(b) of the 1986 Act makes it clear that the two provisions apply and cover different situations and there is no conflict, much less a real one, between the two. Whereas the 1986 Act deals with the obligation of a Muslim husband vis-a-vis his divorced wife including the payment of maintenance to her for a period of two years of fosterage for maintaining the infant/infants, where they are in the custody of the mother, the obligation of a Muslim father to maintain the minor children is governed by Section 125, Cr. P.C. and his obligation to maintain them is absolute till they attain majority or are able to maintain themselves, whichever date is earlier. In the case of female children this obligation extends till their marriage. Apart from the statutory provisions referred to above, even under the Muslim Personal Law. the right of minor children to receive maintenance from their father, till they are able to maintain themselves, is absolute. . 9. Prof. Tahir Mahamood. in his book ""Statute-Law relating to Muslims in India"" (1995 Edn.) while dealing with the effect of the provisions of Section 125. Cr.P.C. on the 1986 Act and the Muslim Personal Law observes at page 198: These provisions of the Code remain fully applicable to the Muslims, notwithstanding the controversy resulting from the Shah Bano case and the enactment of the Muslims Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986. There is nothing in that Act in any way affecting the application of these provisions to the children and parents governed by Muslim law.... As regards children, the Code adopts the age of minority from the Majority Act, 1875 by saying : ""Minor means a person who, under the provisions of the Indian Majority Act; 1875 (9 of 1875) is deemed not to have attained his majority-"" - [Explanation to Section 125(1), Clause (a\')|. Ordinarily, thus, every Muslim child below 18 can invoke the Cr.P.C. law to obtain maintenance from its parents if they ""neglect or refuse"" to maintain it despite ""having sufficient means"".... By Muslim Law, maintenance (nafaqa) is a birth right of children and an absolute liability of the father. Daughters are entitled to maintenance till they gel married if they are bakira (maiden), or till they get remarried if they are Thayiba (divorcee/widow). Sons are entitled to it till they attain bulugh if they are normal: and as long as necessary if they are handicapped or indigent. Providing maintenance to daughters is a great religious virtue. The Prophet had said: Whoever has daughters and spends all that he has on their upbringing well, on the Day of Judgment, be as close to me as two fingers of a hand. If a father is a poverty-stricken and cannot therefore provide maintenance to his children, while their mother is affluent, the mother must provide them maintenance subject to reimbursement by the father when his financial condition improves. 10. Thus, both under the personal law and the statutory law (Sec. 125. Cr.P.C.) the obligation of a Muslim father, having sufficient means, to maintain his minor children, unable to maintain themselves, till they attain majority and in case of females till they get married, is absolute, notwithstanding the fact that the minor children are living with the divorced wife. 11. Thus, our answer to the question posed in the earlier part of the opinion is that the children of Muslim parents are entitled to claim maintenance under Section 125, Cr.P.C. for the period till they attain majority or are able to maintain themselves, whichever is earlier, and in case of females, till they get married, and this right is not restricted, affected or controlled by divorcee wife\'s right to claim maintenance for maintaining the infant child/children in her custody for a period of two years from the date of birth of the child concerned under Section 3(1)(b) of the 1986 Act. In other words Section 3(1)(b) of the 1986 Act does not in any way affect the rights of the minor children of divorced Muslim parents to claim maintenance from their father under Section 125, Cr.P.C. till they attain majority or are able to maintain themselves, or in the case of females, till they are married. 12. It, therefore, follows that the learned Trial Court was perfectly right in directing the payment of amount of maintenance to each of the three children as per the order dated 19-1-1993 and the learned 2nd Additional Sessions Judge also committed no error in dismissing the revision petition filed by the respondent. The High Court, on the other hand, fell in complete error in holding that the right to claim maintenance of the children under Section 125, Cr.P.C. was taken away and superseded by Section 3(1)(b) of the 1986 Act and that maintenance was payable to the minor children of Muslim parents only for a period Of two years from the date of the birth of the child concerned notwithstanding the provisions of Section 125. Cr.P.C. The order of the High Court cannot, therefore, be sustained. It is accordingly set aside. The order of the Trial Court and the Revisional Court is restored. This appeal succeeds and is allowed but without any orders as to cost. \' 13. The arrears of maintenance in respect of the children shall be paid by the respondent to the appellant-mother, who filed the petition on their behalf, within one year from the date of this order in four equal installments, payable quarterly. The first installment shall be paid on or before August 15, 1997 and thereafter every three months. Any single default in the payment of the arrears will entitled the appellant to recover the entire balance amount at once with 12% interest through the Trial Court in the manner prescribed by the Code. The respondent shall continue to pay maintenance as directed by the trial Court, till the children attain majority or are able to maintain themselves, and in the case of the daughters, till they get married.'}"

She as per her own averments, had got married to Mr. John Fletcher in the year 1995 and got divorced from him in the year 30.09.2001. Thus, the appellant is a divorcee. {Para 16} 17. The claim for maintenance has been made under Section 21 of HAMA which provides for the dependents who may claim maintenance. 18. It provides for 9 categories of relatives in which the “divorced daughter” does not feature. An unmarried or widowed daughter is recognized to have a claim in the estate of the deceased, but a “divorced daughter” does not feature in the category of dependents entitled to maintenance. 19. The appellant being a divorcee has a claim for maintenance against her husband even after her divorce. The appellant being conscious of her right of maintenance against the husband, has sought to explain that since her husband is not traceable, she is unable to claim maintenance from him. However difficult situation as it may be, but under the HAMA as she is not a “dependent” as defined under the Act and thus not entitled to claim maintenance from her mother and brother. IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI MAT.APP.(F.C.) 89/2018 MALINI CHAUDHRI\xa0 Vs\xa0RANJIT CHAUDHRI & ANR.\xa0 CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SURESH KUMAR KAIT HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA Author: NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J Pronounced on: 13th September, 2023. CM APPL. 17818/2018(Condonation of delay) 1. Vide the present application, the applicant/appellant seeks condonation of 60 days‟ delay in filing the present appeal. 2. For the grounds and reasons stated in the present application, the application is allowed, the delay of 60 days in filing the present appeal is condoned. 3. Accordingly, the present application is disposed of. 4. The present Appeal under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 read with Sections 96 and 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'CPC') has been filed on behalf of the appellant against the impugned Order dated 04.01.2018 passed by the learned Judge, Family Court, South-East, Saket, New Delhi, whereby the Application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 of the respondents herein has been allowed and the Petition under Section 22 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as 'HAMA') of the appellant for claiming maintenance has been rejected. 5. The appellant is the daughter of respondent No. 2/Smt. Indira Chaudhri and Late Shri Vijay Kumar Chaudhari/father and the sister of respondent No. 1/Ranjit Chaudhri. She is a divorcee and filed the Petition under Section 22 of HAMA claiming maintenance from the respondents. 6. The grandmother of the appellant came from Pakistan to Delhi and acquired privileged properties and estates under the Re-settlement Scheme and also secured employment with the assistance of the Indian as well as the British Government. After the demise of grandmother, her properties and estates devolved upon Shri Vijay Kumar Chaudhri, father of the appellant and respondent No.1. 7. The father of the Appellant died in the year 1999, leaving behind four legal heirs, namely, his wife/respondent No. 2, son, Mr. Ranjit Chaudhri/respondent No. 1, daughters, Smt. Kamini Wahi and the appellant/Malini Chaudhri. The appellant has claimed that she was not given any share as a legal heir. 8. It was also claimed that the father of the appellant had left the Will dated 25.09.1999, whereby 9 acres of land situated near Rozka Village, Haryana to the appellant and her sister, Smt. Kamini Wahi. Because of the details and the Khasra No. of these 9 acres of land were not specified, the appellant was never able to trace the land and never got any share in the land. The Probate Petition No. 191/2000 was filed before the Calcutta High Court in respect of Will dated 25.09.1999 of Late Shri Vijay Kumar Chaudhri and the same was probated on 10.07.2000. 9. The appellant had further asserted that a joint meeting of family members was held and the respondents agreed to pay Rs. 45,000/- per month to the appellant towards her maintenance, on an assurance that she would not press for her share in the property bequeathed by her father. Accordingly, the respondents had been paying the maintenance to the appellant regularly till November, 2014. But thereafter, they failed and neglected to pay any maintenance. Faced with the extreme shortage of funds, she demanded her share in the ancestral properties, but the respondents flatly declined to give her anything. 10. The appellant got married to one Mr. John Fletcher in the year 1995 in Guru Bumli Bala. However, the appellant‟s husband, Mr. John Fletcher deserted the appellant and went to the United States of America (USA) and eventually, the appellant was granted ex parte divorce on 30.09.2001. 11. The appellant has claimed that the respondents be directed to pay her an amount of Rs 1,00,000/- per month as maintenance as she is a dependant of HUF under Section 22 of HAMA. 12. The respondents filed the Application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 for rejection of the petition of the appellant as being barred by law. It was stated that in view of the admitted fact of the appellant being married to Mr. John Fletcher, she is not a „dependant‟ as provided under Section 21 of the HAMA, and thus, she is not entitled to maintenance from her brother and mother. The application was allowed vide Order dated 04.01.2018 and the petition was rejected. 13. Being aggrieved by the impugned Order dated 04.01.2018, the present appeal has been preferred by the appellant. 14. The appellant has asserted that the issue whether she is a “dependant” under Section 21 of the HAMA Act is a mixed question of fact and law which cannot be decided summarily. Her expenses include salary to maid servants, drivers, cooks, daily food and medical expenses and other sundry expenses, which add up to Rs. 75,000/- per month. It is claimed that the learned Judge did not take into consideration that she did not receive any money, alimony or maintenance from her husband, Mr. John Fletcher. As her husband is not traceable, the appellant cannot seek any alimony or maintenance from him. 15. Submissions heard. 16. It is the admitted case of the parties that the appellant is the daughter of the respondent No. 2 and sister of the respondent No. 1. She as per her own averments, had got married to Mr. John Fletcher in the year 1995 and got divorced from him in the year 30.09.2001. Thus, the appellant is a divorcee. 17. The claim for maintenance has been made under Section 21 of HAMA which provides for the dependents who may claim maintenance. 18. It provides for 9 categories of relatives in which the “divorced daughter” does not feature. An unmarried or widowed daughter is recognized to have a claim in the estate of the deceased, but a “divorced daughter” does not feature in the category of dependents entitled to maintenance. 19. The appellant being a divorcee has a claim for maintenance against her husband even after her divorce. The appellant being conscious of her right of maintenance against the husband, has sought to explain that since her husband is not traceable, she is unable to claim maintenance from him. However difficult situation as it may be, but under the HAMA as she is not a “dependent” as defined under the Act and thus not entitled to claim maintenance from her mother and brother. 20. Pertinently, the appellant has admitted that her father vide Will dated 25.09.1999 had bequeathed 9 acres of land situated near Rozka Village, Haryana to her and her sister/Kamini Wahi. Though she claims that since the exact location and address of the land was not mentioned, she was not able to trace the land to claim her share, but during the course of arguments, learned counsel for the respondents had clarified that the land was sold in the year 2001 jointly by the appellant and the sister, Smt. Kamini Wahi and they had shared the sale proceeds. 21. As has been rightly observed by the learned Judge, Family court, the appellant has already received her share from the estate of her father and having received her share, she cannot again raise any claim of maintenance afresh from the respondents. 22. It is significant to observe that in a joint meeting, considering the situation of the appellant, the mother/ respondent No. 2 had agreed to pay\xa0her Rs. 45,000/- per month which has been paid till November, 2014. 23. Significantly, it has also been disclosed that the respondent No. 2/mother had purchased the Flat No. 4A, Second Floor, D2, Kalini Kunj, New Delhi-110065 jointly with the appellant from her own funds, only with an intent to secure the well-being of the appellant. The respondent No. 2/mother has already made arrangements for providing the residence to the appellant. It cannot be overlooked that the respondents being the brother and mother had also supported the daughter/appellant by voluntarily giving her Rs.45,000/- per month to her till 2014. 24. The learned Judge, Family Court, has observed that appellant being the divorced daughter of the respondent No. 2 and sister of the respondent No. 1, is not entitled to claim any maintenance in the above discussed circumstances under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act. 25. We find no infirmity in the impugned Order dated 04.01.2018 rejecting the Petition under Section 22 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act. 26. Accordingly, the present appeal along with pending applications, if any, is dismissed. (NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA) JUDGE (SURESH KUMAR KAIT) JUDGE SEPTEMBER 13, 2023""}"

Challenge in this appeal is to the order of interim maintenance granted at Rs.25,000/- for the wife and the minor daughter of the appellant. 2. The main petition viz., H.M.O.P.No.2568 of 2017 has been filed by the appellant seeking divorce on the ground of cruelty. Pending the said petition the wife filed I.A.No.2 of 2019 seeking interim maintenance at Rs.1,00,000/- each per month for herself and the minor daughter. 3. The said petition was resisted by the husband contending that he has taken a break from his job for doing his Ph.D and he is only taking part-time employment and drawing Rs.20,000/- per month. Therefore, the maintenance as claimed should not be granted. 4. At the hearing, the wife apart from producing certain details of business that is carried on by the husband, also produced the details of the agricultural land holdings of the husband. Considering the cumulative 2/6 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A.No.2118 of 2023 effect of the documents that were produced, the learned Family Judge granted Rs.12,500/- per month each to the wife and the daughter as interim maintenance. Hence, this appeal. 5. We have heard Mr.Suchit Anant Palande, learned counsel appearing for the appellant. 6. Though Mr.Suchit Anant Palande, learned counsel appearing for the appellant would very persuasively argue that the maintenance awarded by the Family Court is on the higher side. We are unable to accept\xa0his submissions. The amount awarded in our opinion would be just about\xa0sufficient for sustainance of one human being at the cost of living today.\xa0 Merely because the petitioner has taken a study holiday or an Academic\xa0 break, his duty to maintain his wife and child cannot take the back seat. \xa0Rs.12,500/- per month each person as of today in our considered opinion is\xa0very meagre. 7. We therefore do not see any reason to interfere with the order of the learned Family Judge. The appeal therefore fails and it is dismissed. No costs. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is closed. 8. The learned counsel for the appellant would submit that there are already talks for settlement of the entire issue between the parties and if the matter is referred to mediation it would do a lot of good to the parties. While dismissing the appeal devoid of merits, we direct the Family Court to refer the matter for mediation to the Mediation Centre attached to the Principal City Civil Court, Chennai or to the Mediation Centre attached to this Court to enable the parties to arrive at a negotiated settlement.

Limitation of powers of guardian of property appointed or declared by the Court .—Where a person other than a Collector, or than a guardian appointed by will or other instrument, has been appointed or declared by the Court to be guardian of the property of a ward, he shall not, without the previous permission of the Court,— ( a ) mortgage or change, or transfer by sale, gift, exchange or otherwise, any part of the immovable property of his ward, or ( b ) lease any part of that property for a term exceeding five years or for any term extending more than one year beyond the date on which the ward will cease to be a minor. 30.

17,https://www.lawweb.in/2023/09/whether-testator-after-bequeathing-his.html,"{'title': 'Whether testator after bequeathing his property absolutely to his wife prescribe how property is to be inherited after death of his wife?', 'content': 'I am of the view that under the aforesaid Will, the predecessor in title of the parties had bequeathed the property to his wife. Such bequeath to the wife cannot be said to be a limited one. The use by the testator of the words ""wholly and solely"" negate, the bequeath to the wife being of a life interest or life estate only. The words used in the Will ""my wife Sushila Chojar, would have the liberty to realize rents and collect gains from all sources concerned and utilize them according to her own wishes"" cannot be read as limiting the right of the wife only to collecting the rents and not having the power to sell the property. The bequeath to the son and daughters is only ""after death of my wife Sushila Chojar"". It becomes further clear from Clause-4 that the bequeath to the son and daughters immediately on the demise of the testator was to be only in the event of the wife predeceasing the testator and not otherwise. Had the bequeath been intended to be to the son and daughters with the wife having only a life interest, Clause-4 would not have been inserted, as in that case the son and daughters would have a residuary interest in the property immediately on the demise of the testator. {Para 36} 37. The Supreme Court in Mauleshwar Mani Vs. Jagdish Prasad MANU/SC/0044/2002 : (2002) 2 SCC 468 on the basis of the words ""Pane ki Musthak"" and ""Ba Akhtiar Intakal"" used in a Will made in Hindi language held the bequeath to be of an unlimited and an absolute estate and not a limited one. The Division Bench of this Court in Judge Pal Khera Vs. Chand Rani Khera MANU/DE/1766/2012 also held the use of the words ""absolutely"" and ""exclusively"" in the Will to be indicative of bequeath of an absolute and unlimited estate and not a limited one. 38. The question which however arises is whether the predecessor in title of the parties having bequeathed the property wholly and solely to his wife could have provided for the manner in which the property was to be dealt with after the death of his wife. In my opinion, he could not have done so.  A testator, once has bequeathed the property wholly and solely to his wife and the wife is alive on the date of the demise of the testator, the property becomes of the wife and any provision in the Will, of the manner in which the property is to be inherited after the demise of the wife, is of no avail. This is the reason that once the property has on the demise of the testator vested in the wife of the testator, the same in the absence of a Will of the wife of the testator, has to be dealt with in accordance with law of succession application to such wife. Reliance if any required in this regard, can be placed on Sadaram Suryanarayana Vs. Kalla Surya Kantham MANU/SC/0886/2010 : (2010) 13 SCC 147. \xa0IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI CSOS 2190/2011 & IA.

The possibility thus of the defendants No. 1&3 being in possession of the original Will and having suppressed the same cannot be ruled out. The plaintiff had no reason to suppress the same. It is not the case of the defendants that the father had put an endorsement of ""cancelled"" on the original, for the plaintiff to be interested in suppressing the original.

The plaintiff has also not led any evidence of the whereabouts of the original Will except for the suggestion in the cross-examination of the defendant No. 3 appearing as DW-1 that the defendant No. 3 had misplaced the original Will. 24. The question which arises is whether from the mere non-availability of the original Will, the revocation by destruction thereof has to be presumed. 25. Section 70 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides that no Will shall be revoked otherwise than (i) by marriage; (ii) or by another Will; (iii) or by some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same and executed in the same manner as a Will; or (iv) by burning or tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator with the intention of revoking the same.

It was further held that in our country, most of the people are not highly educated and do not in every case take the care of depositing the Will in the bank or with the Solicitors and as a result of which the possibility of the Will being stolen, lost or surreptitiously removed by interested persons cannot be excluded.\xa0It was yet further held that when there is no obvious reason or clear motive for the testator to revoke the Will and yet the Will is not found on the death of the testator, it may well be that the Will was misplaced or lost or was stolen by the interested persons. \xa0An interesting discussion in this respect is also to be found in the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of Orissa in Brundaban Chandra Vs.

The plaintiff has instituted this suit, for partition of property bearing No. 29/19, East Patel Nagar, New Delhi (,,suit property), and for permanent and mandatory injunctions with respect to the property, pleading:- I) that late Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar (father of the plaintiff and the three defendants) was granted leasehold rights in the suit property vide registered perpetual lease deed dated 23.01.1981 executed in his favour by the President of India through the Land & Development Office; II) that late Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar executed a registered Will dated 18.11.1991 recording that the plaintiff had been financially helpful to him during his lifetime and bequeathing 55% share in the suit property to the plaintiff and 5%, 20% and 20% to defendants No. 1,2 &3 respectively; III) that it was also envisaged under the Will that the wife of Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar (Smt. Sushila Chojar) would be entitled to possession of the suit property and to realise rent therefrom during her lifetime and upon her demise, the property would devolve upon the legal heirs as per the ratio provided in the Will aforesaid; IV) that Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar expired on 18.11.1998 leaving behind his wife, the plaintiff (son), and the defendants (daughters) as his only natural heirs; the wife of Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar also expired on 30.01.2007; V) that the plaintiff is in possession of the ground floor of the suit property whereas the defendant No. 3 is in occupation of the first and second floors; the defendants No. 1&2 reside in their respective matrimonial homes; VI) that though the plaintiff is also in occupation of a room on the second floor of the suit property but the entry thereto has been blocked by defendant No. 3 by putting a lock on the entrance of the second floor; VII) that a meeting was arranged on 02.06.2011 between the plaintiff and the defendants where the plaintiff expressed the desire to partition the suit property as per the Will of Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar but the said request was refused by the defendants No. 1 to 3 who insisted that the property be divided between the four legal heirs in equal shares; VIII) that the request of the plaintiff to get the suit property mutated in the ratio contained in the Will and thereafter have the same converted into freehold from leasehold was also turned down; IX) that the plaintiff was thus constrained to get issued a legal notice dated 15.06.2011 calling upon the defendants to partition the suit property in the said ratio and the same was duly served on all the defendants; and, X) that though the defendants No. 1&3 refused to accept the notice but a reply dated 24.06.2011 was received from the defendant No. 2 who in paragraph 3 thereof has accepted the fact that her late father Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar had left behind a Will whereunder she was entitled to 20% share in the suit property and that she has no objection to the said Will. The plaintiff has accordingly prayed for a decree, of partition of the suit property, declaring the shares of the plaintiff and the defendants therein as per the Will aforesaid, of permanent injunction restraining the defendants from creating third party rights in the suit property and of mandatory injunction directing the defendants to join in applying for mutation of the property as per the shares under the Will aforesaid and to thereafter in applying for getting the leasehold rights in the suit property converted into freehold. 2. The defendants No. 1&3 have contested the suit, by disputing the existence of any Will and further claiming an oral family settlement between the heirs of Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar in December 1998, pleading:- (a) that under the aforesaid family settlement, the parties had affirmed that Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar had died intestate and the suit property was partitioned by metes and bounds by the mother of the parties and the plaintiff was allotted the ground floor, defendant No. 3 was provided the first floor and the defendant No. 1 was given the second floor, with the common areas to be used by all the parties; the defendant No. 2 who was very well placed, was given roof rights over the second floor; (b) that the parties since then, have been in possession of their respective portions for more than 12 years and the family settlement has thus been fully acted upon; (c) that the plaintiff has suppressed the material fact that Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar, upon realizing that the document got registered by the plaintiff at the office of the Sub Registrar was a Will, had in the presence of the plaintiff, torn and destroyed the same; this was declared so by the father in the presence of the defendants and the plaintiff even had agreed that he would not claim any share under the Will; (d) that the plaintiff has been residing in Dehradun since the last three years and it is the plaintiff who has put a lock on the room of the second floor to harass the defendants; (e) that the Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar has also left various bank deposits/movable property etc. which under the family settlement were directed by the mother of the parties to be kept deposited for a period of fourteen years and the plaintiff is thus liable to disclose and render accounts thereof; (f) that the defendants No. 1&3 have never been served with any legal notice and that the defendant No. 2 has colluded with the plaintiff to wrongfully admit the untenable claim of the plaintiff; (g) that the plea of the plaintiff of being in occupation of a room on the second floor is false since the entire second floor is in possession of defendant No. 1, though for the purpose of convenience she has been mostly living in her matrimonial house. 3. The defendant No. 2 has also a filed a written statement and has though not disputed the Will but claimed that she cannot be compelled to apply for mutation or get the property converted into freehold;  it is pleaded that the suit property being leasehold, cannot be partitioned since the same would be in conflict with the Government Policy and the terms and conditions of the lease deed. 4. The plaintiff has filed a replication to the written statements of defendants No. 1&3 denying any family settlement or knowledge on any movable properties. He has denied possession of defendant No. 1 of the second floor and stated that he was not even in Delhi when the Will was registered and was working in Mumbai at that time. The plaintiff has also filed a replication to the written statement of defendant No. 2 but nothing new has been stated therein. 5. Vide ex-parte ad-interim order dated 09.09.2011, while issuing summons of the suit, the parties were directed to maintain status quo with respect to title and possession of the suit property. Vide subsequent order dated 13.04.2012, the said interim order was made absolute and the following issues were framed in the suit: 1) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to 55% share in the suit property in terms of the registered Will dated 18.11.1991 executed by his late father Shri Shanti Sarup Chojar? OPP 2) Whether the suit property bearing number 29/19, East Patel Nagar, New Delhi is liable to be partitioned by metes and bounds in accordance with the Will executed by the father of the parties? OPP 3) Whether there is any family settlement deed between the parties executed during the lifetime of the mother of the parties? OPD 1 &3 4) Whether the Will dated 18.11.1991 has been executed by late Shri Shanti Sarup Chojar in sound disposing mind? OPP 5) Relief. Evidence was recorded before the Local Commissioner and the counsels of the parties were heard and judgment reserved. The plaintiff thereafter filed application being I.A. No. 7476/2013 for leading additional evidence. The plaintiff, vide the said application seeks to correct his error of not confronting Advocate M.N. Sharma (PW2) with the certified copy of the registered Will during his examination in chief on 05.09.2012. The defendants No. 1&3 have contested the said application by filing a reply thereto stating that no application lies after the hearing has been concluded and the judgment in the matter reserved; they have also pointed out that it is not open to the plaintiff to fill up the lacunas in his evidence after the same were highlighted during the final arguments. The counsels were heard on the said application also and the order thereon also reserved with the clarification that if the application is dismissed, the judgment in the suit would be pronounced along with the order on the application. 6. The plaintiff, in his evidence filed affidavits by way of examination in chief of himself (PW1) and Advocate M.N. Sharma (PW2) who is claimed to have drafted the Will as well as attested the same. The same were tendered in evidence. Mr. Hemant Bhatia, Record Keeper, Office, Sub Registrar, Kashmiri Gate (PW3) was also summoned with relevant records for production of the registered Will. The defendants No. 1&3 tendered in evidence affidavits by way of examination in chief of defendant No. 3 (DW1) and Ms. Rashmi Batra (DW2) \xad a family friend of the defendants family and alleged to be a witness to the family settlement. All the witnesses were duly cross examined by the opposing counsels. The defendant No. 2 neither led any evidence nor cross-examined the witnesses, neither of the plaintiff nor of defendants No. 1&3. 7. The controversy for adjudication in the suit centres around the existence of the Will of the father and the effect if any of the family settlement, again if any, on the said Will. 8. As far as the existence of the Will is concerned, not only the defendant No. 2, but even the defendants No. 1&3 have expressly admitted the same. The defendants No. 1&3 in this regard, in para 3 of the preliminary submissions of their written statement have pleaded: 3. That the plaintiff has also suppressed the material facts that his father in his presence had told that the plaintiff had taken him to the office of the Sub Registrar and got registered a document. When the father of the plaintiff came to know that the document purported to be was a Will he torn out and destroyed the same. This was declared by the father of the parties in the presence of the defendants. The plaintiff had agreed in the presence of his father that he would not claim any will and for this reason after the death of his father, the legal heirs have arrived at a mutual oral family settlement. and in para 1 of the preliminary submissions have pleaded as under: ....The plaintiff has suppressed the material facts that after the death of late Shri Shanti Swaroop Chojar on 18.11.1998, there had taken place a family settlement at the instance of Smt. Sushila Chojar. In the said family settlement, it was affirmed by all the parties that Shri Shanti Swaroop Chojar had died intestate. The aforesaid, in my opinion, amounts to unequivocal admission by the defendants No. 1&3 also of not only the valid execution and registration of the Will by the father but also of knowledge of the father of the contents of the Will, even if, of after the execution and registration of the Will. I am further of the view that once the defendants No. 1&3 have so admitted the knowledge of the father of the contents of the Will and have pleaded that the father destroyed the Will because he did not intend to bequeath the property as per the said Will, if the defendants No. 1&3 fail in proving that the father so destroyed the Will, not only are they bound by admission of execution and registration of the Will but are also to be deemed to have admitted that the said Will is as per the want of the father. The father, even if at the time of execution did not have knowledge of contents of the document executed and registered by him, if not proved to have destroyed the Will, has to be deemed to have approved of the contents. It matters not, whether the knowledge of the contents was of the time of execution or of after execution. Thus, the enquiry under Issues No. 1, 2 & 4 which pertain to the Will, has to be of proof of destruction of the Will. 9. If the defendants No. 1&3 fail to prove destruction of the Will but prove the family settlement, pleaded as under in paras 4-5, 6 and 10 of parawise reply in the written statement: 4-5. .....As already stated after the death of father of the plaintiff, there had taken place a mutual settlement and it was specifically agreed that the property would devolve by inheritance in accordance with law. It may be mentioned that the defendant No. 3 has been in possession of the first floor as owner ever-since family settlement. Similarly the defendant No. 1 had been in possession of the second floor as owner. It is again specifically denied that there was any registered will and / or rights were to devolve on the parties by virtue of the alleged will. It had always been accepted by all the parties that there was settlement during the life time of the mother as mentioned above, and no will was left by the father of the parties. It is therefore, absolutely wrong that the plaintiff wanted share as per the alleged will. It may again be mentioned that since no will was left by the father of the parties, the bank deposits were never apportioned as per the alleged will but had been kept to be divided later on so that movable property / money is not dwindled. 6. ....The plaintiff admits that he is in possession of the ground floor. His possession of the ground floor is only in terms of the family settlement as mentioned above. 10. .....However, after the death of the father, there had been family settlement as mentioned above and it is most unfortunate that after enjoying possession of the ground floor, for more than 12 years, exclusively the plaintiff has filed this suit malafide with a view to sell the whole house and go away with cash. He is living in Dehradun. In view of the facts stated in this written statement, there is no question of again partitioning the property by metes and bounds.......The property already stands partitioned by virtue of the oral family settlement which had been acted upon. Otherwise, the answering defendant would have also claimed possession of the ground floor also. But the defendant have always honoured the family settlement., then the question for adjudication would be, the effect if any of such Family Settlement on the Will and which would be decided under Issue No. 3. Though, no specific issue has been framed on the plea of defendant No. 2, of the property being impartible, but that aspect will also be considered under Issue No. 3. 10. I accordingly proceeded to adjudicate the issues. Issues No. 1, 2 & 4 11. As aforesaid, all the defendants have expressly admitted the execution and registration of the Will of the father on which the claim of the plaintiff for a 55% instead of 25% share in the property which he would have as per law of succession applicable in the absence of a Will, is pegged. However, it is the case of the defendants No. 1&3 that it was the plaintiff who had taken the father to the office of the Sub Registrar and got a document registered but when the father came to know that the document got registered from him was a Will, he tore and destroyed the same. It is thus for the defendants No. 1&3 to prove that the plaintiff took the father to the office of the Sub Registrar and got registered a document which the father executed without knowing that it was his Will, and that the father upon coming to know of the same, tore and destroyed the same. Though Issue No. 4 also addresses the aspect of the father being in a sound disposing mind at the time of execution thereof but no such defence is found in the written statement of the defendants No. 1&3 and such issue appears to have been framed in a routine manner. Rather, it is the case of the defendants No. 1&3 that the father, though not aware at the time of execution and registration of the contents of the document got executed and registered, subsequently became aware of the same and being not in agreement therewith, tore and destroyed the Will. The father could not have tore and destroyed the Will without being in a sound disposing mind. 12. The plaintiff appearing as PW-1, Sh. M.N. Sharma, Advocate appearing as PW-2 as also by the Record Keeper of the office of the Sub Registrar-I, Kashmiri Gate, Delhi appearing as PW-3 have purported to prove the Will. However, it may be highlighted that the original Will has not come before the Court. While the plaintiff purported to prove a certified copy (obtained from the office of the Sub Registrar Kashmiri Gate) of the Will as PW-1/3, the witness from the office of the Sub Registrar deposed on the basis of the copy of the Will in the record brought by him. It is the case of the defendants No. 1&3 that the original has not been produced because it is destroyed. 13. As far as the plea of the defendants No. 1&3, of the plaintiff having got executed and registered the document from the father without the father knowing the nature and contents of the document, the same is without any particulars and vague. As aforesaid, it is not the case of the defendants No. 1&3 that the father, at the time of execution and registration of the document owing to illness or any other reason, was not in his senses. In the ordinary course of human conduct and behaviour and otherwise, a person is presumed to know the consequences of his actions. It was thus for the defendants No. 1&3 to plead and prove, as to exercising what undue influence and / or by making what mis-representations, the plaintiff managed to get the document executed and registered from the father without the father knowing the nature and contents of the document. No such particulars have been taken. The plea thus to the said effect is bald. 14. Though the plaintiff in his replication to the written statement of the defendants No. 1&3 pleaded that he was working in Mumbai and was not in Delhi when the Will was registered but did not depose so in his examination-in-chief. However, in response to the cross-examination by the counsel for the defendants No. 1&3, he deposed: (i) that the Will was not executed in his presence; (ii) that he came to know of the Will subsequently when he came from Bombay and when the father told him of the execution of the Will; (iii) that he had never seen the original Will; (iv) that he told the defendants of the Will immediately after the demise of the father and all the defendants admitted the same; (v) that he was living on the ground floor along with the parents since October, 1995 and first and second floors of the property were lying vacant from 1998 to 2004, though under his supervision and the defendant No. 3 came in occupation of the first floor in March/April, 2004 for a temporary period, as her husband was sick; (vi) that he had not informed of the Will, neither to the MCD nor to the L&DO nor to any other department; (vii) that he was in service and was posted outside Delhi from 1965 till his resignation in 1995; (viii) that he could not produce any documentary proof of having rendered financial assistance to his father; (ix) that his wife had started working in 1983 in Dehradun and so remained working till her retirement in the year 2005. 15. A perusal of the cross-examination also shows that the defendants No. 1&3, even in the cross-examination of the plaintiff, did not put to the plaintiff any circumstance or representation, taking advantage of / by making of which the plaintiff got the document which subsequently transpired to be a Will executed and registered from the father. In fact, the plaintiff was not even controverted qua his statement that he was not present in Delhi at the time of execution and registration of the document. The only suggestion given was that after the father had come to know that the plaintiff has procured a document as a Will, the father destroyed the same and which was denied by the plaintiff. 16. PW-2 Sh. M.N. Sharma, Advocate in his affidavit by way of examination-in-chief deposed that he had drafted the Will as per the instructions of Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar; that Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar was in sound and disposing mind and physically fit and had himself read over the contents of the document and had signed the same in his presence and in the presence of another witness Sh. Ravinder Kumar Rampal. In his cross- examination by the counsel for the defendants No. 1&3, he deposed: (a) that he did not personally know Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar who had come to him as a client; (b) that he had earlier not done any legal work for Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar but had seen his proof of identity; (c) that at the time of execution and registration, Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar was accompanied by the other witness Sh. Ravinder Kumar Rampal and the Deed Writer; however, the Deed Writer left after introducing Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar; (d) that he did not recognize the plaintiff and had seen him for the first time on the date of his deposition; (e) that the Sub Registrar has seen the document of identification of Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar. 17. It is significant that no suggestion even was given by the counsel for the defendants No. 1&3 in the cross-examination of PW-2 that the plaintiff had accompanied Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar at the time of execution and registration of the Will. 18. The defendant No. 3 Smt. Suraksha Madan appearing as DW-1 in her affidavit by way of examination-in-chief reiterated that the father, upon coming to know that the document got executed and registered from him was a Will, tore and destroyed the same and that is why the plaintiff had not filed the original Will before the Court. She in her evidence also did not disclose as to in what circumstances and my making what representation, the plaintiff could make the father sign and execute the document without the father knowing the nature and contents of the document. 19. In her cross-examination, she deposed: (I) that in the year 1991 i.e. the year of registration of the Will, the plaintiff was doing service in Mumbai; (II) that she was not sure, whether on 18.11.1991 i.e. the date of execution and registration of the Will, the plaintiff was in Delhi or Mumbai; (III) that ""may be"" Sh. Ravinder Kumar Rampal being the other attesting witness to the Will, was living in the adjoining property at that time; (IV) that she could not tell ""the exact period when the Will was torn"" by the father the father; had told her of having torn the Will in the year 1996-1997; (V) that she was not aware about the Will and came to know of the same only when the father so informed her; (VI) that her father was called an Electrical Engineer and was doing business; (VII) denied the suggestion that the father had never torn the Will and in fact she had misplaced the Will; (VIII) that the talk in which ""the plaintiff agreed in front of the father that he will not claim anything under the Will"" never happened. 20. The only other witness examined by the defendants did not depose about the Will or its destruction but in her cross-examination stated that the mother of the parties had told her about the Will and the same having been torn. 21. As would be apparent from the above, the defendants have failed to prove; either that the plaintiff had got executed and registered the document titled as and purporting to be the Will from the father without the father knowing the nature and contents thereof, or, of the father having torn the Will. 22. The fact however remains that the original Will has not come before the Court. 23. The plaintiff has also not led any evidence of the whereabouts of the original Will except for the suggestion in the cross-examination of the defendant No. 3 appearing as DW-1 that the defendant No. 3 had misplaced the original Will. 24. The question which arises is whether from the mere non-availability of the original Will, the revocation by destruction thereof has to be presumed. 25. Section 70 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides that no Will shall be revoked otherwise than (i) by marriage; (ii) or by another Will; (iii) or by some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same and executed in the same manner as a Will; or (iv) by burning or tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator with the intention of revoking the same. Therefrom it follows that from a mere non-availability of the original Will, the presumption of revocation by destruction thereof, is not to be drawn. It has to be proved by the person who pleads such revocation by destruction that the Will was destroyed with the intention of revoking the same. To that effect, as aforesaid, no evidence has been led by the defendants No. 1&3. 26. The Supreme Court in Durga Prashad Vs. Debi Charan MANU/SC/0250/1978 : (1979) 1 SCC 61 held that where a Will has been properly executed and registered by the testator and not found at the time of death, the question whether the presumption that the testator had revoked the Will can be drawn or not will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. It was further held that in our country, most of the people are not highly educated and do not in every case take the care of depositing the Will in the bank or with the Solicitors and as a result of which the possibility of the Will being stolen, lost or surreptitiously removed by interested persons cannot be excluded. It was yet further held that when there is no obvious reason or clear motive for the testator to revoke the Will and yet the Will is not found on the death of the testator, it may well be that the Will was misplaced or lost or was stolen by the interested persons.  An interesting discussion in this respect is also to be found in the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of Orissa in Brundaban Chandra Vs. Ananta Narayan Singh Deo MANU/OR/0046/1956 : AIR 1956 Orissa 151 and in Salem Town Bazaar Street, Kannika Vs T.K. Sadasivam Chettiar MANU/TN/0322/1980. 27. In the light of the said legal position, the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in Pt. Devi Charan Vs. Durga Pershad MANU/DE/0042/1967 : AIR 1967 Delhi 128 relied on by the counsel for the defendants no. 1 and 3 and in which case, in the facts and circumstances thereof, a presumption of destruction from non availability of the original was drawn, is of no avail. 28. Else, a Will like any other document may be proved either by primary evidence i.e. by producing and proving the original or by secondary evidence, within the meaning of Sections 62 & 63 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. 29. The plaintiff in his evidence, as aforesaid, attempted to prove a certified copy of the Will obtained from the office of the Sub Registrar and to which objection was taken by the counsel for the defendants No. 1&3 and which objection is also to be dealt with now. The plaintiff examined one of the attesting witnesses of the Will Sh. M.N. Sharma, Advocate. He, in his affidavit by way of examination-in-chief though generally referred to the Will but not with respect to any particular document, not even with reference to the certified copy of the Will placed by the plaintiff on record. No such reference was got made from him even when he tendered the said affidavit into evidence. It was in this context, enquired from the counsel for the plaintiff during the hearing, as to how it could be known, as to with respect to what document the witness was deposing and how the attesting witness could be said to have identified the signatures of the testator or of the other witnesses or his own signatures on any document/Will. In fact, it was unnerved by the said enquiry, that the counsel for the plaintiff has subsequently moved an application for additional evidence. Reliance was however placed on Mahesh Kumar Vs. Vinod Kumar MANU/SC/0208/2012 : (2012) 4 SCC 387 and on Hameed Vs. Kanhaiya 2004 Allahabad Law Journal 3654 to contend that even a certified copy of the Will could be proved and on Ram Lal Vs. Hari Krishan MANU/DE/0349/1986 : AIR 1988 Delhi 73 and Sita Ram Vs. R.D. Gupta MANU/PH/0200/1981 : AIR 1981 Punjab & Haryana 83 to contend that the Will has been proved. 30. Though the copy of the Will in the office of the Sub Registrar was requisitioned and produced by PW-3 but on a different date from the one when the PW-2 was examined. PW-3 was producing the same of course was not privy to execution and registration and could not have proved the Will. 31. As far as the proof by the plaintiff of the Will is concerned, the plaintiff not being an attesting witness thereto, could not have proved the same. A Will, being a document required by Section 63 of the Succession Act to be attested, under Section 68 of the Evidence Act cannot be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has been called for proving its execution. The plaintiff has thus led the evidence mechanically and without regard to law and which lacunas/errors, the counsel for the plaintiff now seeks to make up, upon being made wiser during the hearing. 32. However, notwithstanding such neglect on the part of the plaintiff in proving his case, I am inclined to hold the Will to have been validly proved for the following reasons and owing whereto do not feel the need to consider the application of the plaintiff for additional evidence, moved out of fright rather than by addressing the reasons herein below mentioned: (A) The defendants No. 1&3 who really are the contesting defendants qua the Will having in their pleadings admitted as aforesaid the valid execution of the Will; (B) The counsel for the defendants No. 1&3 also, notwithstanding the counsel for the plaintiff having not referred to any document sought to be proved as Will, while examining the attesting witness thereto, having proceeded to cross-examine him on the premise that the witness has deposed about the document on record; a perusal of the entire cross-examination shows that the counsel for the defendants No. 1&3 proceeded on the premise that the document deposed by the said witness was the certified copy of the Will on record; (C) PW-3 from the office of the Sub Registrar who had brought file from the office of the Sub Registrar containing a copy of the Will registered in that office having deposed that the same contained ""the original signatures of the testator Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar on both the pages along with the signatures of the witnesses"" and he having not been controverted on the said aspect, though he stated that he could not identify the signatures; I am in this regard reminded of what the lawyers of a bygone era, steeped in trial and which art is now dying, used to say, that a Will mostly not proved in the classic sense by the Advocate for the propounder thereof but is nevertheless proved by unnecessary and excessive cross-examination by the Advocate for the party challenging the Will; (D) It has been held in Prithi Chand Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh MANU/SC/0420/1989 : (1989) 1 SCC 432, Kewal Krishan Mayor Vs. Kailash Chand Mayor MANU/DE/1201/2001 : 95 (2002) DLT 115, Continental Telepower Industries Ltd. Vs. UOI MANU/DE/1691/2009  and Narender Nath Nanda Vs. The State MANU/DE/1626/2010 that a document containing carbon copy of the signatures is also primary evidence; (E) It has been held in Y. Narsimha Rao Vs. Y. Venkata Lakshmi MANU/SC/0603/1991 : (1991) 3 SCC 451 that even a photocopy of the original is secondary evidence. The certified copy of the Will on record is a photocopy of the original; (F) The mistakes in proof are of the Advocate of the plaintiff. It is the settled principle in law (see Rafiq Vs. Munshilal MANU/SC/0076/1981 : (1981) 2 SCC 788) that a litigant ought not to suffer for mistake of his Advocate. The mistake here is undoubtedly of counsel in proving the Will in the classic sense. Though in some subsequent decisions it has been held that a litigant is bound by mistakes of his Advocate but the mistakes here are such, qua which the plaintiff could not have taken any remedial action. I on appreciation of the pleadings, evidence and the documents on record, am satisfied of the existence and validity of the Will and hold that the Will dated 18.11.1991 of the predecessor in title qua the suit property stands proved. 33 . Though the plaintiff as aforesaid has failed to give any reason for non-production of the original Will but from a reading of the entirety of the evidence including the lengthy cross-examination by the counsel for the defendants No. 1&3 of the plaintiff and of the replies given by the defendant No. 3 in her cross-examination, it is abundantly proved that the defendant No. 3 had much more access than the plaintiff to the parents. The possibility thus of the defendants No. 1&3 being in possession of the original Will and having suppressed the same cannot be ruled out. The plaintiff had no reason to suppress the same. It is not the case of the defendants that the father had put an endorsement of ""cancelled"" on the original, for the plaintiff to be interested in suppressing the original. Rather, it is the plea of the defendants No. 1&3 that the original was torn and destroyed and which they have failed to prove. 34. It is not the case of any of the defendants that as per the said Will even if proved, the parties do not have the shares in the property as pleaded by the plaintiff. 35. I have nevertheless perused the Will which I have held to have been proved and find the same in paras 2 to 4 thereof to be providing as under: 2. I Shanti Sarup Chojar (Testator) affirm and bequeath that after my death my wife Sushila Chojar (legatee) would be wholly and solely entitled to get possession of all my property both movable and immovable as mentioned in para one above of the testament. Besides my wife Sushila Chojar would have the liberty to realize rents and collect gains from all sources concerned, and utilize them according to her own wishes. 3. I Shanti Sarup Chojar (Testator) affirm and bequeath that after death of my wife Sushila Chojar (a) my son Satish Kumar Chojar who leaves one son and one daughter and being financially helpful to me through out my life would be entitled to fifty five percent share in my property both movable and immovable, (b) my daughter Savita Kapoor w/o Shri Santosh Kumar Kapoor, who bears three sons shall be entitled to twenty percent share in my property both movable and immovable, (c) my daughter Suraksha Madan wife of Shri Lalit Kumar Madan would be entitled to twenty percent share in my property both movable and immovable, (d) my daughter Subhashni Chopra wife of Shri Subhash Chander Chopra who does not bear any child, nor has adopted any child, would be entitled to five percent share in my property both movable and immovable. 4. I Shanti Sarup Chojan affirm and bequeath that if the death of my wife Sushila occurs before my death then after my death the disposal of my property both movable and immovable will be dealt with as mentioned above in para three of the (Will) Testament. 36. I am of the view that under the aforesaid Will, the predecessor in title of the parties had bequeathed the property to his wife. Such bequeath to the wife cannot be said to be a limited one. The use by the testator of the words ""wholly and solely"" negate, the bequeath to the wife being of a life interest or life estate only. The words used in the Will ""my wife Sushila Chojar, would have the liberty to realize rents and collect gains from all sources concerned and utilize them according to her own wishes"" cannot be read as limiting the right of the wife only to collecting the rents and not having the power to sell the property. The bequeath to the son and daughters is only ""after death of my wife Sushila Chojar"". It becomes further clear from Clause-4 that the bequeath to the son and daughters immediately on the demise of the testator was to be only in the event of the wife predeceasing the testator and not otherwise. Had the bequeath been intended to be to the son and daughters with the wife having only a life interest, Clause-4 would not have been inserted, as in that case the son and daughters would have a residuary interest in the property immediately on the demise of the testator. 37. The Supreme Court in Mauleshwar Mani Vs. Jagdish Prasad MANU/SC/0044/2002 : (2002) 2 SCC 468 on the basis of the words ""Pane ki Musthak"" and ""Ba Akhtiar Intakal"" used in a Will made in Hindi language held the bequeath to be of an unlimited and an absolute estate and not a limited one. The Division Bench of this Court in Judge Pal Khera Vs. Chand Rani Khera MANU/DE/1766/2012 also held the use of the words ""absolutely"" and ""exclusively"" in the Will to be indicative of bequeath of an absolute and unlimited estate and not a limited one. 38. The question which however arises is whether the predecessor in title of the parties having bequeathed the property wholly and solely to his wife could have provided for the manner in which the property was to be dealt with after the death of his wife. In my opinion, he could not have done so. A testator, once has bequeathed the property wholly and solely to his wife and the wife is alive on the date of the demise of the testator, the property becomes of the wife and any provision in the Will, of the manner in which the property is to be inherited after the demise of the wife, is of no avail. This is the reason that once the property has on the demise of the testator vested in the wife of the testator, the same in the absence of a Will of the wife of the testator, has to be dealt with in accordance with law of succession application to such wife. Reliance if any required in this regard, can be placed on Sadaram Suryanarayana Vs. Kalla Surya Kantham MANU/SC/0886/2010 : (2010) 13 SCC 147. 39. It is the admitted position that the mother of the parties died intestate. In accordance with the law of succession applicable to her, on her demise, the property would be inherited equally by her children i.e. by the plaintiff and the defendants No. 1&3. 40. Thus, though I hold the plaintiff to have proved the Will and the defendants to have failed to prove the Will having been revoked by destruction but on an interpretation of the Will, I am unable to find the plaintiff entitled to 55% share in the property. Rather, the plaintiff and the three defendants are found to have an equal share in the property. The Issues No. 1, 2 & 4 are decided accordingly. Issue No. 3 41. The plea of the defendants No. 1&3 is that the plaintiff in the family settlement after the death of the father, not only admitted the father having died intestate but also to partition of the property, with the plaintiff getting the ground floor, defendant No. 3 getting the first floor, defendant No. 1 getting the second floor and the defendant No. 2 having the roof right over the second floor. Though in view of my interpretation of the Will, the plea of the defendants No. 1&3, of the plaintiff having in the said family settlement agreed to the father having died intestate becomes redundant but for the sake of completeness, the same is also adjudicated. 42. Though in my view, the share even if any of the parties in the ratio as pleaded by the plaintiff, could in a family settlement have been agreed to be 25% only but the fact remains that the defendants have utterly failed to prove any such family settlement. The defendant No. 3 appearing as DW-1 in her cross-examination admitted that there is no Deed or document of family settlement and there is no other documentary proof thereof also. There is also nothing to show that the parties at any time acted in consonance with the said family settlement. The mere factum of the plaintiff being in possession of the ground floor and the defendant No. 3 being in possession of first floor is not indicative thereof. It has been admitted by the defendant No. 3 in evidence that the parents of the parties were living on the ground floor of the property and the upper floors were being rented. It has further been admitted by the defendant No. 3 in evidence that the plaintiff from time to time used to reside with the parents on the ground floor. The defendant No. 3 has in cross-examination admitted to have come to occupy the first floor after she had left the official accommodation allotted to her husband at Pandara Road, New Delhi. The defendant No. 3 in her cross-examination of the plaintiff and in her own cross-examination has replied that the house tax of the property remained one. Had the parties felt the need for any family settlement as is pleaded by the defendants No. 1&3, the parties in the ordinary course of human behaviour, would have also pursuant thereto dealt with the property accordingly. It is not the case of the defendant No. 3 that the property tax was shared floorwise. The defendant No. 1 has not even appeared as a witness to prove the family settlement. The evidence of the DW-2 examined is hear say. I thus hold the defendants No. 1&3 to have failed to prove the family settlement and decide Issue No. 3 against the defendants No. 1&3. 43. As far as the plea of the defendant No. 2 of the property being impartible is concerned, the said question is no longer res integra. I have in Madan Lal Vs. Kuldeep Kumar MANU/DE/4039/2013 , on a conspectus of case-law in this regard held that the terms of the perpetual lease of the land underneath the property prohibiting partition thereof, do not prevent the superstructure from being partitioned. There is thus no merit in the said plea of the defendant No. 2. 44. The plea of the defendant No. 2 of the property being impartible and the plea of the defendants No. 1&3 of the property having already been partitioned in family settlement having been negated, a decree for partition and for which relief the suit has been filed, has to follow. However, the plaintiff having failed in his plea of having inherited 55% share in the property under the Will of the father and the shares of the parties having been found to be equal, a preliminary decree for partition is passed declaring the plaintiff as well as the three defendants to be having 25% share each in the property. 45. The plaintiff is also found entitled to the relief of permanent injunction restraining the defendants from dealing with the property in which all the parties have a share from dealing therewith. Of course such injunction will be till the execution of the final decree for partition. Accordingly, the parties are restrained till the execution of the final decree for partition in this suit from alienating, encumbering or parting with possession of any share or portion of the property. 46. As far as the claim of the plaintiff for mandatory injunction is concerned, the same is found to be in interest of all the parties and in aid to the final decree for partition to follow in this suit. Accordingly, all the parties are directed to, within sixty days hereof, join in making an application for mutation of the leasehold rights in the land underneath the property from the name of Sh. Shanti Sarup Chojar to their own names and to thereafter also take steps for conversion of the leasehold rights in the said land into freehold. Needless to state that all the expenses therefor will be born equally by the parties and if any of the parties fail to contribute his/her share, the same shall be deducted with interest, out of his/her share in the property. Decree Sheet be drawn up.'}"

This appeal impugns the judgment and decree dated 13.09.2004 of the Court of Additional District Judge (ADJ), Delhi of dismissal of suit No. 247/1998 filed by the appellant/plaintiff for partition of property No. II-F/6, Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi and Shop No. 81-A, Khanna Market, Lodhi Colony, New Delhi along with a strip of land adjacent thereto.

The appeal, vide order dated 17.08.2006, was admitted for hearing and the ex parte ad-interim order made absolute till the disposal of the appeal.

The counsels have been heard. 3. The appellant/plaintiff instituted the suit from which this appeal arises against his brother Sh. Jagdish Lal who died during the pendency of the suit and whose legal heirs are respondents 1 (1) to (6) in this appeal, pleading: (i) that the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 were brothers, both residing in the same property bearing No. II-F/6, Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi on the first and the ground floors respectively; the said property was bequeathed to the parties by their father Late Sh. Boota Ram through registered Gift Deed dated 30.01.1980; (ii) that the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 had also purchased shop No. 81A, Khanna Market, Lodhi Colony, New Delhi vide registered Sale Deed dated 24.01.1970; that as per the policy of the Government, the additional strip of land behind the said shop was also purchased by the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 from the department through a registered Lease Deed dated 02.04.1980; (iii) that the Lajpat Nagar house as well as the Khanna Market property were allotted by the respondents/defendants No. 2&3 Land & Development Office (L & DO) and the land underneath both the properties was leasehold, lease whereof was granted by the respondents/defendants No. 2 & 3 L & DO; (iv) that the Lajpat Nagar house was in or about the year 1983-84 got constructed by the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and while the ground, first and second floors thereof were jointly constructed by them, the third floor was constructed by the appellant/plaintiff alone from his own funds and for his personal requirement; (v) that there was a lot of tension between the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 with respect to the said properties held jointly by them; (vi) the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 were also partners along with two other brothers of the parties in the business run in the name and style of M/s. Time Centre from the Khanna Market property; a Deed of Dissolution thereof was executed on 26.06.1991 by all the partners; (vii) that an agreement was also entered into by virtue of which it was agreed upon that the ground floor of the Lajpat Nagar house shall be the property of the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and the other floors thereof will be the property of the appellant/plaintiff; (viii) that the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 after the settlement and in contravention of lease of the land underneath wanted to convert the ground floor of the Lajpat Nagar house to commercial and which was resisted by the appellant/plaintiff who also filed a suit for permanent injunction in which an interim order directing maintenance of status quo qua possession and user had been made; that the said action of the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 had threatened the said property being re-entered by the respondents/defendants No. 2 & 3 L & DO; (ix) that the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 had been avoiding to settle the matter with respect to the Khanna Market property, regarding its goodwill, income and profits etc. including the additional strip of land adjacent thereto which formed part of the shop itself; and, (x) that the Khanna Market property was in possession of the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 who was liable to render true and correct accounts of the business being carried on therein since 26.06.1991, since when the appellant/plaintiff had been ousted therefrom. Accordingly, relief of partition of the Lajpat Nagar house and the Khanna Market property and relief of rendition of accounts of the business being carried on from the Khanna Market property was claimed. 4. The predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 contested the suit, by filing a written statement, on the grounds: (a) that the appellant/plaintiff had concealed that by virtue of the Dissolution Deed dated 26.06.1991, the partnership between the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and their two other brothers was dissolved in respect of business being carried on in the aforesaid Khanna Market property and in another shop bearing No. 47 also in Khanna Market; (b) that thereafter by virtue of Family Settlement Deed, the ground floor of the Lajpat Nagar house and the Khanna Market property vested in the ownership of the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and the first, second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar house vested in the ownership of the appellant/plaintiff; (c) that the original of the said Family Settlement Deed was with the appellant/plaintiff; (d) that the second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar house were let out at a rent of Rs. 3,200/- per month and Rs. 2,600/- per month; that prior to the Family Settlement, the said rent was being equally shared by the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1; however after the Family Settlement, the appellant/plaintiff alone had been receiving the rent; (e) denying that the third floor of the Lajpat Nagar house had been constructed by the appellant/plaintiff alone from his own funds; (f) denying that he wanted to convert the ground floor of the Lajpat Nagar house into commercial; and, (g) that as the appellant/plaintiff had not honoured the Family Settlement and had filed a suit for partition, the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 was entitled to half of the rent of the second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar house from June, 1991 onwards which had been exclusively appropriated by the appellant/plaintiff; accordingly a counter claim for the same was also made. 5. The respondents/defendants No. 2&3 in their written statement inter alia pleaded that the lease of the land underneath both the properties could not be sub-divided. 6. The appellant/plaintiff filed a replication to the written statement of the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 inter alia pleading: (I) that the Dissolution Deed dated 26.06.1991 was of partnership but did not settle any title of the Khanna Market property; (II) denying that any valid or lawful settlement enforceable in law had taken place between the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 though admitting the agreement whereunder the ground floor of the Lajpat Nagar house was to belong to the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and upper floors to the appellant/plaintiff; denying that there was any valid Family Settlement and pleading that under the law such settlement has to be registered and otherwise the same is of no consequence; (III) denying that there were any tenants on the second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar house and pleading that even otherwise since the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 was enjoying the fruits of occupation of the Khanna Market property and which were much more than the monthly value of the rent of the second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar house, he was not entitled to any share in the rent; (IV) admitting that the tenant in the Lajpat Nagar house was paying Rs. 2,900/- per month but pleading that the same comprised of rent of Rs. 2,000/- per month and Rs. 900/- per month for fixture and fittings and that the fixture and fittings were taken away by the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 in June, 1991 and the same were got arranged by the tenant and the rent was accordingly reduced to Rs. 2,200/- per month; (V) denying that there was any valid or lawful settlement of the Khanna Market shop and pleading that in any case there was no settlement with respect to the additional strip of land adjacent thereto; and, (VI) denying the counter claim of the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 also for the same reason. 7. After the demise of the original defendants No. 1 Sh. Jagdish Lal, his widow Smt. Nirmal Rani also filed a written statement on the same lines as Sh. Jagdish Lal. 8. On the pleadings aforesaid of the parties, the following issues were framed on 06.12.2000: (i) Whether there was a family settlement and a partition of the property has already been effected as alleged in preliminary objection of the Written Statement? OPD. (ii) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of partition and rendition of account? OPP (iii) Relief. And following additional issue was framed on 27.01.2003: (ii)(a) Whether the defendant is entitled for rendition of accounts? OPD. 9. The appellant/plaintiff besides himself examined three other witnesses. The respondents/defendants No. 1 besides examining one of them viz. Sh. Kuldeep Kumar, examined two other witnesses. The respondents/defendants no. 2 & 3 (L & DO) examined one of its officers. 10. The learned ADJ has dismissed the suit, finding/observing/holding: (i) that while according to the respondents/defendants No. 1 there was a family partition by virtue of which partition of the properties had been effected and the suit for partition and rendition of account thus did not lie, according to the appellant/plaintiff the alleged family partition was inadmissible in evidence since it was an unregistered document; by virtue of the family arrangement, the property was being partitioned and therefore it was required to be compulsorily registered; that since the family arrangement was not registered, therefore it was inadmissible in evidence; even otherwise, the said family arrangement was not a voluntary affair but was executed under pressure of police and was never acted upon as was evident from the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 himself claiming share in the rental income and also partition of the property; (ii) that it was the contention of the respondent/defendant No. 1 that the plea that the family arrangement was executed under police pressure was an afterthought and there was no such plea of the appellant/plaintiff in the pleadings; that the family arrangement was acted upon and the parties were enjoying their rights in respective properties; (iii) that as per the document of family arrangement Ex. PW2/D1, the ground floor of the Lajpat Nagar house and the shop in Khanna Market had fallen to the share of the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and the first, second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar house had fallen to the share of the appellant/plaintiff; (iv) that it was the undisputed fact that as per the Dissolution Deed dated 26.06.1991, the partnership business being run in the Khanna Market property was to be run exclusively by the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1; (v) that the appellant/plaintiff in his replication to the written statement of the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 had not denied the execution of the Family Settlement and had only taken the plea, that the same being not registered, was of no consequence; (vi) however the appellant/plaintiff in his evidence took a new plea for the first time that the Family Settlement was executed under police pressure and the same was not acted upon, without having pleaded so; (vii) that the appellant/plaintiff in cross-examination admitted that he had not made any police complaint in regard to execution of family arrangement under police pressure; (viii) that the family arrangement was dated 17.06.1991 and the suit was filed on 05.12.1992 and between the said two dates, the appellant/plaintiff had ample opportunity to complaint if he had been compelled to execute the family settlement under police pressure; however neither was any such complaint made nor even any notice issued to the predecessor of the respondents/defendants no. 1 of having got the family settlement executed under police pressure; no such plea was taken in the plaint or in the replication also; thus the plea of Family Settlement having been executed under police pressure did not inspire confidence; (ix) that the appellant/plaintiff had examined his two brothers and a brother-in-law all of whom had deposed of the Family Settlement dated 17.06.1991 having been arrived at under police pressure; however all of them admitted their signatures on the Family Settlement; (x) that the Deed of Family Settlement having been signed by as many as five witnesses, it was unbelievable that all of them could have signed under police pressure of only one police official who was deposed to be present; (xi) that in fact one brother and the brother-in-law of the appellant/plaintiff had in cross-examination stated that the Deed of Family Settlement was not even executed in their presence, falsifying their testimony of the same having been executed under police pressure; (xii) that the said witnesses who were close relatives of the appellant/plaintiff were thus deposing at the behest of the appellant/plaintiff; (xiii) relying on Kale Vs. Deputy Director of Consolidation MANU/SC/0529/1976 : 1976 (3) SCC 119, K.G. Shivalingappa (dead) by Lrs. Vs. G.S. Aishwarappa MANU/MP/0675/2010 : 2004 VIII AD(SC) 128 and host of other judgments, it was held that a partition deed though unregistered could be relied upon to establish the severance of joint status; (ix) that there was evidence to show that the properties were partitioned and the respective parties were enjoying the properties and it\'s usufruct separately; (x) that the appellant/plaintiff in cross-examination admitted that he was in possession of first, second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar house and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 was in possession of ground floor of the Lajpat Nagar house; (xi) that the appellant/plaintiff in his cross-examination also admitted that though prior to the date of Family Settlement i.e. 17.06.1991, the rent of the second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar house was being shared between the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 but thereafter the rent was being appropriated by him only; (xii) that the appellant/plaintiff in cross-examination had further admitted that Khanna Market property was exclusively with the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and after him with the respondents/defendants No. 1; (xiii) that all the aforesaid facts were also admitted by the witnesses of the appellant/plaintiff; (xiv) that the aforesaid facts clearly showed that the Family Settlement had been acted upon in its true spirit; (xv) that though the appellant/plaintiff in the plaint itself had referred to the agreement with respect to the Lajpat Nagar house but had suppressed that the same also dealt with the Khanna Market property; (xvi) that the appellant/plaintiff had thus admitted the Family Settlement qua the Lajpat Nagar house but not qua the Khanna Market property; (xvii) that the appellant/plaintiff could not be permitted to accept part of the settlement and renege from the other part; (xviii) that the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and after him the respondents/defendants No. 1 were not disowning the Family Settlement and their only plea was that in case of partition, the respondents/defendants No. 1 were also entitled to rental income of the Lajpat Nagar house; this did not in any manner reflect that the family arrangement had not been acted upon; (xix) that the respondents/defendants No. 1 had thus established that there was a Family Settlement and partition of the Lajpat Nagar house and the Khanna Market shop; (xx) that the floor wise division of the Lajpat Nagar house did not amount to sub-division of the land underneath the house; reliance in this regard was placed on Inderjeet Singh Vs. Trilochan Singh 1991 RLR 239; and, (xxi) however the additional strip of land adjacent to Khanna Market shop did not find mention in the Family Settlement and accordingly the same was liable to be partitioned; however the same being incapable of division by metes and bounds was liable to be sold and the sale proceeds divided/shared between the appellant/plaintiff and the respondents/defendants No. 1. Accordingly, the suit for the relief of partition of Lajpat Nagar house and the Khanna Market shop and for the relief of rendition of accounts of the business of the Khanna Market shop was dismissed and the additional strip of land adjacent to Khanna Market shop ordered to be sold and the sale proceeds thereof to be divided equally between the appellant/plaintiff and the respondents/defendants No. 1. 11. I may at the outset record that the respondents/defendants No. 1 have not challenged the decree for partition of the additional strip of land adjacent to the Khanna Market shop. I have during the hearing enquired from the counsels as to what value they give thereof but neither counsel has instructions in this regard and it is not deemed expedient to adjourn the matter for the said purpose inasmuch as the said exercise can be done in the proceedings for final decree for partition. 12. The counsel for the appellant/plaintiff has challenged the judgment and decree, insofar as of dismissal of suit for partition of the Lajpat Nagar house and the Khanna Market shop and for rendition of accounts of the profits earned from the Khanna Market shop, contending: (A) that a Family Settlement can only be with respect to coparcenary property or property acquired by inheritance and not with respect to acquired property; that in the present case the Lajpat Nagar house had been acquired by Gift Deed, even though by the father and not by inheritance and the Khanna Market shop had been acquired by purchase; (B) that there was no occasion for a Family Settlement as there was no dispute; though the appellant/plaintiff had in the plaint pleaded that there was tension between the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 with respect to the properties held by them jointly but the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 in his written statement had denied the said fact; (C) that a reading of the deed of the Family Settlement in the present case shows that the same is not a memorandum or record of a settlement or partition already effected but in fact the partition in itself and such a document is compulsorily registrable and being not registered, is of no avail; (D) that the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 in his written statement having also sought the relief of partition and of recovery of his share of rent of the second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar House, had himself also given a go bye to the Family Settlement; (E) that the deed of Family Settlement was not signed by all the family members; admittedly the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 had two other brothers also; (F) that Family Settlement can only be where the property is acquired from joint family funds; it is argued that the property in the present case could have been acquired by either of the appellant/plaintiff or the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 along with a stranger and in which case there could be no partition by Family Settlement and thus there can be no Family Settlement merely because the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 were brothers; (G) that no case of any oral settlement preceding the execution of the deed of Family Settlement has been pleaded or proved; (H) that the deed of Family Settlement vesting the Khanna Market shop in the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 only, thereby extinguishing the rights of the appellant/plaintiff therein, required compulsory registration; (I) Reliance is placed on: (i) Kale (supra); (ii) Roshan Singh Vs. Zile Singh MANU/SC/0679/1988 : AIR 1988 SC 881; (iii) K.G. Shivalingappa (supra); (iv) Jagdish Rai Vs. Tek Chand MANU/DE/1111/2001 : 94 (2001) DLT 719; and, (v) Smt. Chanderwati Vs. Lakhmi Chand (Dead) through Lrs. MANU/DE/0466/1987 : AIR 1988 DEL 13. 13. Per contra, the counsel for the respondents/defendants No. 1 has contended that the appellant/plaintiff having divided the properties with the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 is estopped from suing for partition. Reliance is placed besides on Kale supra on Amarjeet Lal Suri Vs. Moti Sagar Suri MANU/DE/0294/2005 : 119 (2005) DLT 295. 14. The counsel for the respondents/defendants No. 2 & 3 L & DO has reiterated that both the Lajpat Nagar house as well as Khanna Market property are situated on leasehold land, leases of which are in the joint names of appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and cannot be sub-divided. He however agrees that this Court besides in Inderjit Singh supra, has in Chiranji Lal Vs. Bhagwan Das MANU/DE/0663/1991 : AIR 1991 Delhi 325, Mohinder Singh Vs. Kartar Lal MANU/DE/1309/1997 & Ram Lal Sachdeva Vs. Sneh Sinha MANU/DE/0222/2000 : 83 (2000) DLT 141  held that partition of superstructure on the leasehold land is not prohibited by the term of the Lease Deed prohibiting sub-division. 15. I will first take up the argument of the counsel for the appellant/plaintiff, of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and their predecessor, by themselves in the written statement/counter claim seeking the relief of partition and realization of their share of arrears of rent of the second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar house, had given a go bye to the deed of Family Settlement, inasmuch as if the said argument were to be accepted, the other arguments raised would only be of academic interest. 16. I am in agreement with the learned Additional District Judge that the respondents/defendants No. 1 and their predecessor, by in their written statement and counter claim seeking the relief of partition and accounts of rent of the second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar house had not given a go bye to the defence in the written statement, of the Family Settlement and of the properties of which partition was sought having already been partitioned. A careful perusal of the written statement of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and their predecessor shows that though they therein also claimed the relief of partition and the counter claim of recovery of their share of arrears of rent of the second and third floors of Lajpat Nagar house, but after praying for dismissal of the suit. Thus the claim for partition and of recovery of share of rent of the second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar house was in alternative to the plea of dismissal of the suit. It is well settled position in law (See B.K.N. Narayana Pillai Vs. P. Pillai MANU/SC/0775/1999 : (2000) 1 SCC 712) that a defendant in a suit is entitled to set up alternative pleas/defences. A holistic reading of the written statement/counter claim of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and their predecessor shows that the prayer for partition and recovery of their share of rent was in alternative to the prayer for dismissal of the suit. 17. I am strengthened in taking the said view from a perusal of the order sheet in the suit. After the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 had filed the written statement with the aforesaid prayer and counter claim, the appellant/plaintiff in his replication did not state that the suit should be decreed on admissions. No application under Order 12 Rule 6 of the CPC was also filed. On the contrary, an application for amendment of the plaint and for impleadment of the respondents No. 2 & 3 L & DO was filed and which was allowed. Even thereafter the appellant/plaintiff did not seek a decree in the suit as would have been the case if both the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 had been seeking for partition. The only inference is that the appellant/plaintiff also understood the prayer in the written statement/counter claim of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and their predecessor, of partition and for recovery of their share of rent of the second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar house, as in alternative to the main defence of dismissal of the suit for the reason of the Family Settlement. The parties got the Issues framed also on the said lines and did not press any other Issue. Had the parties not been at issue for the reason of both claiming partition, the suit would have been decreed under Order 15 of the CPC and Issues only qua rendition of accounts would have been got framed. 18. Not only so, the parties thereafter proceeded for lengthy trial, adjudication of applications for interim relief and appointment of Local Commissioner. The appellant/plaintiff could not after such conduct, spring a surprise on the respondents/defendants No. 1 by contending that as per the written statement of the respondent/defendant No. 1 and their predecessor itself, the appellant/plaintiff was entitled to the reliefs claimed in the suit. 19. I now proceed to examine the appeal on merits. The counsel for the appellant/plaintiff inspite of being prodded has been unable to in any of the judgments cited or otherwise show that a Family Settlement can only be with respect to coparcenary or inherited property and not with respect to the self-acquired joint property of family members. The contention that merely because the property can be jointly acquired with non family members also, there can be no settlement of self-acquired property even if jointly owned by family members, is to say the least found preposterous. 20. I have gone through the dicta of the Supreme Court in Kale supra which is the locus classics on Family Settlement and do not find the same to be restricting Family Settlement only to settlements of coparcenary or inherited properties and assets. Rather, it has been held: by virtue of a Family Settlement or arrangement members of a family descending from a common ancestor or a near relation seek to sink their differences and disputes, settle and resolve their conflicting claims or disputed titles once for all in order to buy peace of mind and bring about complete harmony and goodwill in the family. The family arrangements are governed by a special equity peculiar to themselves and would be enforced if honestly made. Reliance was placed on ""Kerr on Fraud"" holding: that the principles which apply to the case of ordinary compromise between strangers, do not equally apply to the case of compromises in the nature of family arrangements. It was further held: the object of the arrangement is to protect the family from long drawn litigation or perpetual strifes which mar the unity and solidarity of the family and create hatred and bad blood between the various members of the family. Today when we are striving to build up an egalitarian society and are trying for a complete reconstruction of the society, to maintain and uphold the unity and homogeneity of the family which ultimately results in the unification of the society and therefore of the entire country, is the prime need of the hour. ... the term ""family"" has to be understood in a wider sense so as to include within its fold not only close relations or legal heirs but even those persons who may have some sort of antecedent title, a semblance of a claim...so that future disputes are sealed for ever and the family instead of fighting claims inter se and wasting time, money and energy on such fruitless or futile litigation is able to devote its attention to more constructive work.........the Courts have, therefore, leaned in favour of upholding a family arrangement instead of disturbing the same on technical or trivial grounds. Where the Courts find that the family arrangement suffers from a legal lacuna or a formal defect the rule of estoppel is pressed into service and is applied to shut out plea of the person who being a party to family arrangement seeks to unsettle a settled dispute and claims to revoke the family arrangement under which he has himself enjoyed some material benefits. Halsbury\'s Laws of England observing as under were quoted with approval: a family arrangement is an agreement between members of the same family, intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit of the family either by compromising doubtful or disputed rights or by preserving the family property or the peace and security of the family by avoiding litigation or by saving-its honour. The Supreme Court held the following to be the essentials of a Family Settlement: (1) The family settlement must be a bona fide one so as to resolve family disputes and rival claims by a fair and equitable division or allotment of properties between the various members of the family; (2) The said settlement must be voluntary and should not be induced by fraud, coercion or undue influence; (3) The family arrangements may be even oral in which case no registration is necessary; (4) It is well-settled that registration would be necessary only if the terms of the family arrangement are reduced into writing. Here also, a distinction should be made between a document containing the terms and recitals of a family arrangement made under the document and a mere memorandum prepared after the family arrangement had already been made either for the purpose of the record or for information of the court for making necessary mutation. In such a case the memorandum itself does not create or extinguish any rights in immovable properties and therefore does not fall within the mischief of Section 17(2) of the Registration Act and is, therefore, not compulsorily registrable; (5) The members who may be parties to the family arrangement must have some antecedent title, claim or interest even a possible claim in the property which is acknowledged by the parties to the settlement. Even if one of the parties to the settlement has no title but under the arrangement the other party relinquishes all its claims or titles in favour of such a person and acknowledges him to be the sole owner, then the antecedent title must be assumed and the family arrangement will be upheld and the Courts will find no difficulty in giving assent to the same; (6) Even if bona fide disputes, present or possible, which may not involve legal claims are settled by a bona fide family arrangement which is fair and equitable the family arrangement is final and binding on the parties to the settlement. 21. I am unable to appreciate as to how, while applying the aforesaid principles, so long as the arrangement is between the family members, it matters whether the properties/assets/affairs being settled are inherited by the Family Members from a common ancestor or have been jointly acquired by the Family Members. No assistance is forthcoming from the counsel for the appellant/plaintiff. The counsel for the appellant/plaintiff appears to confuse the expression used by the Supreme Court in the judgment supra, of \'legal heirs\' used to describe, amongst who all a Family Settlement can be, with the assets/affairs which can be settled by a Family Settlement/Family Arrangement. The reasoning given in Kale supra for according said status to Family Settlements/Family Arrangements equally applies to the inherited assets as well as self-acquired assets. 22. The Supreme Court in Kale, has invoked the rule of \'estoppel\' to waive the legal and technical lacunas in family settlements/arrangements. The said rule of estoppel applies against the appellant/plaintiff in the present case also. Not only is the appellant/plaintiff estopped for the reason of having signed the deed of Family Settlement, whereunder he made the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 agree to the appellant/plaintiff becoming the exclusive owner of the first, second and third floors of the Lajpat Nagar house, but also for the reason that the said Family Settlement dated 17.06.1991 also led to the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 agreeing to the terms and conditions of the Dissolution Deed dated 26.06.1991 of the partnership business, whereunder the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 took over the business exclusively till then being carried on in partnership in the Khanna Market property. It is well nigh possible that had the appellant/plaintiff on 17.06.1991 not executed the deed of Family Settlement whereunder the Khanna Market shop jointly owned by the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 was to exclusively vest in the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1, he would not have shortly thereafter on 26.06.1991 agreed to the dissolution aforesaid. With respect to the dissolution of the partnerships also it may be stated that there are two Dissolution Deeds on record, one of the partnership business of M/s. Jagdish Watch Company being carried on in shop No. 47, Khanna Market by the appellant/plaintiff, predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and their brother Sh. Hira Lal and the other of the partnership business in the name and style of M/s. Time Centre being carried on in shop No. 81A, Khanna Market subject matter of this lis by the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and their two brothers Sh. Hira Lal and Sh. Joginder Pal. The predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 took over all the debts and liabilities of the partnership business in the Khanna Market shop subject matter of this lis. The appellant/plaintiff after having so made the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 act, is estopped from resiling. 23. I also do not find any merit in the only other argument of the counsel for the appellant/plaintiff, of the Family Settlement having been reduced to writing, being required to be registered. I have already quoted hereinabove the parameters laid down by the Supreme Court in Kale and as per which the family arrangement can be oral and in which case no registration is necessary and even where it is reduced into writing, it requires registration only when the terms of the writing affect the partition and not where writing is merely a record of the oral partition. 24. The writing in the present case is in Hindi under title ""Parivarik Samjhauta"" and the recital thereof is to the effect that the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondent No. 1 \'are dividing their joint properties in the manner appearing in the document\'. Thus the document is merely a record of what was being done by the parties and does not by itself partition the properties. The counsel for the appellant/plaintiff instead of reading from the document in Hindi, has relied on the language in the impugned judgment and in the pleadings, of the properties having been partitioned ""by virtue of"" the Deed of Family Settlement but which is not the correct way of interpretation of Deeds or documents. At this stage, I may record that though the counsel for the appellant/plaintiff has argued that there was no occasion for Family Settlement since there were no dispute but as aforesaid, the appellant/plaintiff himself only pleaded tension between the parties with respect to the joint properties but notwithstanding the denial thereof by the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1, in his affidavit by way of examination-in-chief has also deposed that there were disputes between the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 with respect to the properties held jointly by them. The appellant/plaintiff cannot now be heard to contend otherwise. 25. Similarly, the plea raised by the appellant/plaintiff of the Family Settlement having not been acted upon is also mala fide. The appellant/plaintiff not only in his pleadings but even in evidence has pleaded that after the date of Family Settlement, the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 were dealing exclusively with the properties which had fallen to their respective share including by removal by the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 of the fittings and fixtures provided to the tenant on the floors of the Lajpat Nagar house which had fallen to the share of the appellant/plaintiff and by exclusive realization of rent thereof by the appellant/plaintiff. 26. Coming back to the aspect whether the writing titled ""Parivarik Samjhauta"" is a record of the Family Settlement or itself creates any rights, I have during the hearing put to the counsel for the appellant/plaintiff whether not ordinarily a formal writing, as the typed document in the present case, is prepared after the parties have reached an understanding and/or orally agreed amongst themselves. Again no answer is forthcoming. All that can be said is that the appellant/plaintiff neither in his own evidence nor in the cross-examination of the witnesses of the respondent/defendant No. 1 has built up a case of there being no such understanding/arrangement having been reached prior to the signing of the document. From the factum of the document titled ""Parivarik Samjhauta"" in the present case being part of a mutual settlement taking place at that time not only qua joint properties but also joint businesses, the preponderance of probability is in favour of the appellant/plaintiff and the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1 and their other two brothers having first arrived at an understanding of partitioning all the assets and businesses and having got prepared the documents affirming the same and thereafter executing the documents on a difference of few days. For this reason also, I am of the view that the document titled ""Parivarik Samjhauta"" was never intended to be itself creating rights in different properties but is merely a memorandum of settlement already arrived at. 27. The other judgments relied upon by the counsel for the appellant/plaintiff turn on the peculiar language of the documents subject matter thereof and do not lay down anything which would dissuade me from the view taken. Rather Smt. Chanderwati supra is not even a case amongst family members. 28. No merit is therefore found in the appeal. 29. I may record that though the finding of the learned Additional District Judge, of the additional strip of land adjacent to the Khanna Market shop being not part of the Khanna Market shop, appears to be erroneous inasmuch as the title thereof was acquired by the appellant/plaintiff only for the reason of being owner of the shop and the counsels also admit that the said strip of land is incapable of independent use and has always been treated as part and parcel of the Khanna Market shop which under the Family Settlement had fallen to the share of the predecessor of the respondents/defendants No. 1, but the said finding having not been challenged and having attained finality, is incapable of interference in this appeal. 30. I may also record that during the hearing attention of the counsel for the appellant/plaintiff was invited to the recent Division Bench judgment of this Court in Madhur Bhargava Vs. Arati Bhargava MANU/DE/0397/2013, also dealing extensively with the subject of Family Settlement and the counsel for the appellant/plaintiff after lunch after going through the said judgment was unable to dissuade me from changing the view taken. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs to the respondents/defendants No. 1. Decree sheet be drawn up.'}"

Any being that is so  capable, is a person whether human being or not and nothing that is not so capable is a person even though he  a man.” Gray defines, “entity to which rights and duties may be attributed”. Paton defines, legal personality is a medium through which some such units are created in whom right scan be vested.
